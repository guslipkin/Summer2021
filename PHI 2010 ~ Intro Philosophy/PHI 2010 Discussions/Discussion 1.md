1. Oh boy. Favorite book and movie is a big one. If I had to choose a favorite movie, which I do now, I’d choose [The Grand Budapest Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Budapest_Hotel). It’s very visually appealing and has a certain charm and whimsy that I enjoy. As for favorite book, any of the Harry Potter books. I was raised on them and find them quite soothing and re-read the series every few years. 
   When not in search of my new favorite movie or book, I enjoy road and mountain biking, hosting game and movie nights, and maintaining and upgrading my computers and bicycles. I’m originally from Framingham, Massachusetts but now live in Lakeland and attend Florida Poly full time.
   I think philosophy is a way of thinking about the world and life. It usually provides some sort of ethical suggestions and are frequently contradictory depending on what the “goal” of the decision is. For example, maximizing company profits vs employee happiness, assuming that they are mutually exclusive.
   Professionally, I’d like to one day manage a city’s public transportation network. Personally, I want to get better at biking and be able to clear gap jumps of any size.

2. “The unexamined life is not worth living for human beings” resonates quite strongly with me. I’ve always been one to ask *why* for just about anything and everything which is usually followed with *how* and sometimes the rest of the usual *w* questions. Rather than saying we need deep introspection or must think carefully about our arguments, his meaning is quite simple. He’s saying that if you don’t question what goes on around you and seek to learn more, you are not living life. While you might, and most likely are, alive, you are not living. If you go through the motions of life without questioning, you may as well be a robot who does precisely what it’s told. Without examining life, we would not *be* humans. We would never have thought that maybe standing on two feet is better than four or than perhaps we can whack some sticks or stones with other stones to create primitive tools. I would however, make one small change to Socrates’ statement. I would change it to “The unexamined life is not worth living for any living creature,” because, again, without examining life before we were humans, we would not be humans now.

3. I agree with Russell’s overarching idea that someone who refuses to question is “imprisoned […],” but I take issue with him singling out philosophy as the driving force behind autonomy. This could be that I have a fundamental misunderstanding of what philosophy is, but I don’t think so. While the origin of many questions is *how* or *why*, many other questions are *I want to see for myself*. For example, in a recent economics class, we were presented with the idea that a stimulus could be restricted to housing and asked to using our foundational knowledge to examine what effects such restrictions would have. 
   I’m going to interrupt myself and stop here because I think I have found my sticking point. Russell seems to believe that philosophy can be both intentional and unintentional, that the resultant questioning of the economics experiment is philosophy while I am laboring under the impression that philosophy is intentional. 
   In any case, I believe that questioning is foundational to humanity. Many other creatures can form basic questions, but very few look inwards and ask “Who am I?”

4. The biggest hole in their argument is that they believe that “enriching my intellectual imagination” is “to waste what precious time we do have left on this planet.” Some people do find enriching themselves to be a waste of time, and they certainly make it known, but I think it is a poor argument. In fact, the response clearly indicates that the author has no intention of philosophizing at all although they just have unintentionally by crafting their response. Thus, their argument is moot as they have just done the very thing they said there was no point in doing and if there was truly no point in philosophizing, then they would not have bothered to respond.

5. As much as I would love to experience a “more complete” reality, I don’t think there is any point daydreaming about it. The fact of the matter is, with our current senses, our most complete reality is the reality we are experiencing right now. If someone is blind, their reality is no less real than mine or yours, it’s simply different. One could argue that your reality is “more real” the fewer senses you have because you’ll have to put more effort into perceiving the “same” amount of reality as your peers. With the wall example, I could look at it and say that it is blue while someone who is blind would have to put in some effort to learn its color by asking someone else or using an app to tell them. Thus, their reality is “more real” because they are more invested in it.

6. I found the strongest cartoon to be B. The man is questioning his belief system for no other reason than that he always believes it. The woman responds by saying not to trust everything you think. I think the very fact that they are examining their own lives simply because they can shows a great deal about how living an examined life can add value. These thoughts do not appear to be precipitated by any event that made them question their beliefs in their beliefs, they’re simply examining their beliefs because they can. One such example for me is the economics example from earlier. Our professor did not prompt us one way or another on what we thought, but asked us to state what we thought and defend it. If we wanted to carry on with our preconceived notions, there was nothing stopping us. We were graded on answering the question and not what our answer was.
   The weakest, I believe, is cartoon A. It says what things people commonly do in their lives but that’s it. Cartoon A completely ignores why we get a job, why we go to work, why we get married, and so on. Some of us might get a job and go to work because we need the money to survive (a much more difficult question is why we need money) and some of us might get a job because they find performing their task fulfilling. Many teachers enjoy teaching and chose that profession because of it. Just because many other people are following a similar path does not mean it’s the *wrong* path, just that it’s the widely accepted path. For example, in this image, the task is to transport cubes. That one guy carved it up into a sphere and is no longer fulfilling his task. Sure he questioned the status quo, but he’s also not doing his job.

   In my life I am certainly going to follow most if not all of those edicts because I want to and because I find those aspects of my life fulfilling or because I don’t see any reason to go against the grain. I am free enough to make the choices that I want to make, and that’s all that matters.

1. Oh boy. Favorite book and movie is a big one. If I had to choose a favorite movie, which I do now, I’d choose [The Grand Budapest Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Budapest_Hotel). It’s very visually appealing and has a certain charm and whimsy that I enjoy. As for favorite book, any of the Harry Potter books. I was raised on them and find them quite soothing and re-read the series every few years. 
   When not in search of my new favorite movie or book, I enjoy road and mountain biking, hosting game and movie nights, and maintaining and upgrading my computers and bicycles. I’m originally from Framingham, Massachusetts but now live in Lakeland and attend Florida Poly full time.
   I think philosophy is a way of thinking about the world and life. It usually provides some sort of ethical suggestions and are frequently contradictory depending on what the “goal” of the decision is. For example, maximizing company profits vs employee happiness, assuming that they are mutually exclusive.
   Professionally, I’d like to one day manage a city’s public transportation network. Personally, I want to get better at biking and be able to clear gap jumps of any size.

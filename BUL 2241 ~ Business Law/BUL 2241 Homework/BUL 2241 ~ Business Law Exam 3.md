1. What is Probable Cause?

   > Probable cause is a requirement of the Fourth Amendment that must be met or exceeded “before police make an arrest, conduct a search, or receive a warrant.” Probable cause exists when the courts believe that you can be reasonably certain that a crime was committed or that there is evidence of a crime that did commit in the place to searched.

4. What is meant by the term “Discharge” in a bankruptcy proceeding?

   > “A bankruptcy discharge releases the debtor from personal liability for certain specified types of debts.” Essentially, in a bankruptcy proceeding, “discharge” means that the debtor is no longer responsible for any debts that are discharged. Such an action is permanent and debtors are no longer able to collect or attempt to collect on the discharged debts.

5. What is a “Negotiable Instrument”, and name three (3) types of such instruments?

   > A “negotiable instrument” is an “unconditioned writing that promises or orders the payment of a fixed amount of money.” There are two categories of instruments: drafts and notes. Drafts order a payment to be made and a note promises that a payment will be made. Certificates of deposit are notes while checks and money orders are drafts.

6. What is the USMCA (hint: new version of NAFTA)? What countries are involved, and how do you feel about free trade as a general principle?

   > The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is a trade agreement that creates a “level playing field for American workers, including improved rules of origin for automobiles, trucks, other products, and disciplines on currency manipulation.” It benefits “farmers, ranchers, and agribusinesses by modernizing and strengthening food and agriculture trade in North America.” It also increases protections for intellectual property.

   > I think free trade is important to make sure that countries are able to import what they don’t have and export excesses of what they do have. However, I also think there should be regulations on trade so that countries don’t abandon their resources in favor of over-taxing low-cost international alternatives.

7. What is contained in an “Environmental Impact Statement”, and who must sign one?

   > An environmental impact statement (EIS) is a document “that outlines the impact of a proposed project on its surrounding environment.” These are mandated for some projects in the United States by federal law. EIS documents usually include a section about the proposed action and its purpose and need, a section that describes the affected environment, a section that provides alternatives to the proposed actions and a description of a no action alternative, and an analysis section. An EIS is signed off on by the governing authority for the project and the EPA.

8. What is “Insider Trading? ....and why is it prohibited?

10. What is the “Doctrine of Foreign Immunity” as it relates to the dynamics between foreign entities?

    > The Doctrine of Foreign Immunity, or Sovereign Immunity, refers to how the government cannot be suid without its consent. This comes from British common law which had the idea that the King could do no wrong. “In the United States, sovereign immunity typically applies to the federal government and state government, but not to municipalities. Federal and state governments, however, have the ability to waive their sovereign immunity.”

 # Extra Credit

11. Explain at least three (3) measures you think the Federal government could implement to help business in the USA rebound from the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

    > 1. Implement single-payer healthcare. In the US, health insurance is most commonly tied to your job. With the pandemic, many people lost their jobs and their insurance. During a pandemic, a health crisis, this is bad. Many people who would have needed treatment did not get it because they would not have coverage and could not afford to pay out of pocket. By moving to single-payer health insurance, overall health insurance costs go down while everyone is covered and able to get the care they need. This includes preventative care that will help people stay in good health so that if they do get COVID, it does not have as much of an effect.
    > 2. Stop bailing out big business and pump cash into small businesses for employee pay. Big businesses grew and continue to grow at extradordinary rates and pay their executives billions each year while under-paying their employees. If such a business needs a bailout, it can be bought out by the federal government to become a national company such as Amtrak or the USPS. This will help the employees of the company and the federal government because it now has control of the profits. Boosting small businesses will help the communities directly and allow them to pay employees a living wage during an economic downturn.
    > 3. Raise the minimum wage. With small business boosted, they’ll be more willing to make the jump to paying a higher minimum wage. They’ll be able to realize it’s a sustainable model while they have government support like I said in point 2. Now that people are being paid more, they’ll go back out into the local economy, including those small business, and begin spreading the wealth back out. This will boost the economy further and allow the fed to withdraw support. In addition, because people are no longer relying on their jobs for health insurance, they’ll feel more comfortable leaving bad jobs which will increase competition among employers and further raise wages and creating a positive cycle.

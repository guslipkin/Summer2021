6. Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) is the largest bottler of Coca-Cola® in Western Europe. The company purchases Coke® and Sprite® concentrate from The Coca-Cola Company (K0), dilutes and mixes the concentrate with carbonated water, and then fills the blended beverage into cans or plastic two-liter bottles. Assume that the estimated production for Coke and Sprite two-liter bottles at the Wakefield, UK, bottling plant is as follows for the month of May:

   | Type   | Amount                    |
   | ------ | ------------------------- |
   | Coke   | 153,000 two-liter bottles |
   | Sprite | 86,500 two-liter bottles  |

   In addition, assume that the concentrate costs \$75 per pound for both Coke and Sprite and is used at a rate of 0.15 pound per 100 liters of carbonated water in blending Coke and 0.10 pound per 100 liters of carbonated water in blending Sprite. Assume that two liters of carbonated water are used for each two-liter bottle of finished product. Assume further that two-liter bottles cost \$0.08 per bottle and carbonated water costs \$0.06 per liter.

   Prepare a direct materials purchases budget for May, assuming inventories are ignored, because there are no changes between beginning and ending inventories for concentrate, bottles, and carbonated water.

### Flexible Budgeting

7. At the beginning of the period, the Fabricating Department budgeted direct labor of \$72,000 and equipment depreciation of \$18,500 for 2,400 hours of production. The department actually completed 2,350 hours of production.

   Determine the budget for the department, assuming that it uses flexible budgeting.

   - $(2350*\frac{72000}{2400})+18500=89000$

### Flexible Budget for Selling and Administrative Expenses for a Service Company

13. OfficeMart Inc. has "cash and carry" customers and credit customers. OfficeMart estimates that 25% of monthly sales are to cash customers, while the remaining sales are to credit customers. Of the credit customers, 30% pay their accounts in the month of sale, while the remaining 70% pay their accounts in the month following the month of sale. Projected sales for the next three months are as follows:

	| Month    | Value   |
	| -------- | ------- |
	| October  | $58,000 |
	| November | 65,000  |
	| December | 72,000  |

### Static Budget versus Flexible Budget

14. The production supervisor of the Machining Department for Hagerstown Company agreed to the following monthly static budget for the upcoming year:

    | **Hagerstown Company Machining Department Monthly Production Budget** |            |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
    | Wages                                                        | $2,250,000 |
    | Utilities                                                    | 72,000     |
    | Depreciation                                                 | 36,000     |
    | Total                                                        | $2,358,000 |

    The actual amount spent and the actual units produced in the first three months in the Machining Department were as follows:

    |      | Amount Spent | Units Produced |
    | ---- | ------------ | -------------- |
    | May  | $1,600,000   | 40,000         |
    | June | 1,950,000    | 48,000         |
    | July | 2,200,000    | 52,000         |

    The Machining Department supervisor has been very pleased with this performance because actual expenditures for May–July have been significantly less than the monthly static budget of $2,358,000. However, the plant manager believes that the budget should not remain fixed for every month but should “flex” or adjust to the volume of work that is produced in the Machining Department. Additional budget information for the Machining Department is as follows:

    | item                               | Value  |
    | ---------------------------------- | ------ |
    | Wages per hour                     | $25.00 |
    | Utility cost per direct labor hour | $0.80  |
    | Direct labor hours per unit        | 1.5    |
    | Planned monthly unit production    | 60,000 |

    1. Prepare a flexible budget for the actual units produced for May, June, and July in the Machining Department. Assume depreciation is a fixed cost. If required, use per unit amounts carried out to two decimal places.

         | Utility costs per hour                                       | $0.80         | $0.80         | $0.80         |
         | Total utilities                                              | $48,000.00    | $57,600.00    | $62,400.00    |

    2. Compare the flexible budget with the actual expenditures for the first three months.

       - |                                   | May           | June          | July          |
         | --------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
         | Total flexible budget             | $1,584,000.00 | $1,893,600.00 | $2,048,400.00 |
         | Actual cost                       | $1,600,000.00 | $1,950,000.00 | $2,200,000.00 |
         | Excess of actual cost over budget | $16,000.00    | $56,400.00    | $151,600.00   |

       1. The Machining Department has performed better than originally thought.
          - **No**
       2. The department is spending more than would be expected.

7. Miller and Sons' static budget for 10,000 units of production includes \$50,000 for direct materials, \$44,000 for direct labor, variable utilities of \$5,000, and supervisor salaries of \$24,000. A flexible budget for 12,000 units of production would show **direct materials of \$60,000, direct labor of ​\$52,800, utilities of \$6,000, and supervisor salaries of \$24,000**.

8. At the beginning of the period, the Assembly Department budgeted direct labor of \$110,000, direct materials of ​\$170,000, and fixed factory overhead of \$28,000 for 8,000 hours of production. The department actually completed 10,000 hours of production. The appropriate total budget for the department, assuming it uses flexible budgeting, is $(10000*\frac{110000}{8000})+(10000*\frac{170000}{8000})+28000=378000$

## Review

1. The standard costs and actual costs for direct materials for the manufacture of 3,000 actual units of product are as follows:

   | Standard Costs   |                          |
   | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
   | Direct materials | 1,040 kilograms at $8.75 |
   |                  |                          |
   | Actual Costs     |                          |
   | Direct materials | 2,000 kilograms at $8.00 |

   The direct materials price variance is $(8-8.75)*2000=$ **1500 favorable**

2. If the actual direct labor hours spent producing a commodity differ from the standard hours, the variance is a **time** variance.

3. The following data relate to direct labor costs for February:

   | Item           | Value                 |
   | -------------- | --------------------- |
   | Actual costs   | 7,700 hours at $14.00 |
   | Standard costs | 7,000 hours at $16.00 |

   The direct labor rate variance is $(14-16)*7700=$ **15400 favorable**.

4. The standard factory overhead rate is \$7.50 per machine hour (\$6.20 for variable factory overhead and $1.30 for fixed factory overhead) based on 100% of normal capacity of 80,000 machine hours. The standard cost and the actual cost of factory overhead for the production of 15,000 units during August were as follows:

   | Actual:                                    |                           |          |
   | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------- |
   |                                            | Variable factory overhead | $360,000 |
   |                                            | Fixed factory overhead    | 104,000  |
   |                                            |                           |          |
   | Standard hours allowed for units produced: | 60,000 hours              |          |

   The fixed factory overhead volume variance is $(80000-60000)*1.3=$ **26000 unfavorable**

5. The term used to describe expenses that are incurred by a specific department is **direct operating** expenses.

6. ABC Corporation has three support departments with the following costs and cost drivers:

   | **Support Department** | **Cost** | **Cost Driver**              |

   ABC has three operating divisions, Micro, Macro, and Super. Their revenue, cost, and activity information are as follows:

   |                              | **Micro** | **Macro** | **Super** |
   | ---------------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
   | Revenues                     | $700,000  | $850,000  | $650,000  |
   | Direct operating expenses    | 50,000    | 70,000    | 100,000   |
   | Number of copies made        | 20,000    | 30,000    | 50,000    |
   | Number of invoices processed | 700       | 800       | 500       |
   | Number of employees          | 130       | 145       | 125       |

   The support department allocation rate for Graphics Production is $\frac{200000}{20000+30000+50000}=2.00$

7. Clydesdale Company has sales of \$4,500,000, invested assets of \$2,000,000, and operating expenses of \$3,600,000. The company has established a minimum return on investment of 7%.

   Clydesdale Company's residual income is $4500000-3600000-(2000000*7\%)=760000$

8. The excess of divisional operating income over a minimum acceptable amount of divisional operating income is **residual income**.

9. Investment centers differ from profit centers in that they **are able to invest in assets**.

10. Motorcycle Manufacturers, Inc., projected sales of 78,000 machines for the year. The estimated January 1 inventory is 6,500 units, and the desired December 31 inventory is 6,000 units. The budgeted production for the year is $78000+6000-6500=77500$

### Direct Materials, Direct Labor, and Factory Overhead Cost Variance Analysis

11. Mackinaw Inc. processes a base chemical into plastic. Standard costs and actual costs for direct materials, direct labor, and factory overhead incurred for the manufacture of 40,000 units of product were as follows:

    |                  | **Standard Costs**                                           | **Actual Costs**              |
    | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
    | Direct materials | 238,000 lbs. at $4.80 per lb.                                | 235,600 lbs. at $4.60 per lb. |
    | Direct labor     | 17,500 hrs. at $17.90 per hr.                                | 17,900 hrs. at $18.20 per hr. |
    | Factory overhead | Rates per direct labor hr., based on 100% of normal capacity of 18,260 direct labor hrs.: |                               |
    |                  | Variable cost, $2.90                                         | $50,240 variable cost         |
    |                  | Fixed cost, $4.60                                            | $83,996 fixed cost            |

       Each unit requires 0.25 hour of direct labor.

       1. Determine the direct materials price variance, direct materials quantity variance, and total direct materials cost variance. Enter a favorable variance as a negative number using a minus sign and an unfavorable variance as a positive number.
          - Direct Materials Price Variance: $(4.6-4.8)*235600=$ **(47120) Favorable**
            Direct Materials Quantity Variance: $(235600-238000)*4.8=$ **(11520) Favorable**
            Direct Materials Cost Variance: $-47120-11520=$ **(58640) Favorable**
    2. Determine the direct labor rate variance, direct labor time variance, and total direct labor cost variance. Enter a favorable variance as a negative number using a minus sign and an unfavorable variance as a positive number.
       - Direct Labor Rate Variance: $(18.2-17.9)*17900=$ **5370 Unfavorable**
         Direct Labor Time Variance: $(17900-17500)*17.9=$ **7160 Unfavorable**
         Direct Labor Cost Variance: $7160+5370=$ **12530 Unfavorable**
    3. Determine the variable factory overhead controllable variance, fixed factory overhead volume variance, and total factory overhead cost variance. Enter a favorable variance as a negative number using a minus sign and an unfavorable variance as a positive number.
       - Variable factory overhead controllable variance: $50240-(70000*.25)=$ **(510) Favorable**
         Fixed factory overhead volume variance: $(18260-[70000*.25])*4.6=$ **3496 Unfavorable**
         Total factory overhead cost variance: $-510+3496=$ **2986 Unfavorable**

    | Invested assets    | 4,900,000          | 4,500,000              |

    *Required:*

    1. Prepare condensed divisional income statements for the year ended December 31, 20Y7, assuming that there were no support department allocations.

       - | Free Ride Bike Company Divisional Income Statements For the Year Ended December 31, 20Y7 | Road Bike Division        | Mountain Bike Division     |
         | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
         | Sales                                                        | $5880000$                 | $6300000$                  |
         | Cost of goods sold                                           | $-2587000$                | $-2961000$                 |
         | Gross profit                                                 | $5880000-2587000=3293000$ | $6300000-2961000=3339000$  |
         | Operating expenses                                           | $-2234600$                | $-2331000$                 |
         | Operating income                                             | $3293000-2234600=1058400$ | $3339000-22331000=1008000$ |

    2. Using the DuPont formula for return on investment, determine the profit margin, investment turnover, and rate of return on investment for each division. *If required, round your answers to one decimal place.*

       - | Division               | Profit Margin                  | Investment Turnover           | ROI                                                      |
         | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
         | Road Bike Division     | $\frac{1058400}{5880000}=18\%$ | $\frac{5880000}{4900000}=1.2$ | $\frac{1058400}{5880000}*\frac{5880000}{4900000}=21.6\%$ |
         | Mountain Bike Division | $\frac{1008000}{6300000}=16\%$ | $\frac{6300000}{4500000}=1.4$ | $\frac{1008000}{6300000}*\frac{6300000}{4500000}=22.4\%$ |

    3. If management desires a minimum acceptable rate of return of 14%, determine the residual income for each division.

       - |                        | Residual Income                 |
         | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
         | Road Bike Division     | $1058400-(4900000*14\%)=372400$ |
         | Mountain Bike Division | $1008000-(4500000*14\%)=378000$ |

    4. On the basis of operating income, the **Road Bike** Division is the more profitable of the two divisions. However, operating income **does not** consider the amount of invested assets in each division. On the basis of residual income, the **Mountain Bike** Division is the more profitable of the two divisions.

   2. Using the DuPont formula for return on investment, determine the profit margin, investment turnover, and rate of return on investment for each division. *If required, round your answers to one decimal place.*

      - | Division               | Profit Margin                 | Investment Turnover           | ROI                                                     |
        | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
        | Road Bike Division     | $\frac{264000}{1650000}=16\%$ | $\frac{1650000}{1500000}=1.1$ | $\frac{264000}{1650000}*\frac{1650000}{1500000}=17.6\%$ |
        | Mountain Bike Division | $\frac{236600}{1690000}=14\%$ | $\frac{1690000}{1300000}=1.3$ | $\frac{236600}{1690000}*\frac{1690000}{1300000}=18.2\%$ |

   3. If management desires a minimum acceptable rate of return of 19%, determine the residual income for each division.

      - |                        | Residual Income                  |
        | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
        | Road Bike Division     | $264000-(1500000*19\%)=-21000$   |
        | Mountain Bike Division | $2236600-(1300000*19\%)=1989600$ |

   4. On the basis of operating income, the **Road Bike** Division is the more profitable of the two divisions. However, operating income **does not** consider the amount of invested assets in each division. On the basis of residual income, the **Mountain Bike** Division is the more profitable of the two divisions.

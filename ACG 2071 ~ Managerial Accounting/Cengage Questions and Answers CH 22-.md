6. Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) is the largest bottler of Coca-Cola® in Western Europe. The company purchases Coke® and Sprite® concentrate from The Coca-Cola Company (K0), dilutes and mixes the concentrate with carbonated water, and then fills the blended beverage into cans or plastic two-liter bottles. Assume that the estimated production for Coke and Sprite two-liter bottles at the Wakefield, UK, bottling plant is as follows for the month of May:

   | Type   | Amount                    |
   | ------ | ------------------------- |
   | Coke   | 153,000 two-liter bottles |
   | Sprite | 86,500 two-liter bottles  |

   In addition, assume that the concentrate costs \$75 per pound for both Coke and Sprite and is used at a rate of 0.15 pound per 100 liters of carbonated water in blending Coke and 0.10 pound per 100 liters of carbonated water in blending Sprite. Assume that two liters of carbonated water are used for each two-liter bottle of finished product. Assume further that two-liter bottles cost \$0.08 per bottle and carbonated water costs \$0.06 per liter.

   Prepare a direct materials purchases budget for May, assuming inventories are ignored, because there are no changes between beginning and ending inventories for concentrate, bottles, and carbonated water.

### Flexible Budgeting

7. At the beginning of the period, the Fabricating Department budgeted direct labor of \$72,000 and equipment depreciation of \$18,500 for 2,400 hours of production. The department actually completed 2,350 hours of production.

   Determine the budget for the department, assuming that it uses flexible budgeting.

   - $(2350*\frac{72000}{2400})+18500=89000$

### Flexible Budget for Selling and Administrative Expenses for a Service Company

13. OfficeMart Inc. has "cash and carry" customers and credit customers. OfficeMart estimates that 25% of monthly sales are to cash customers, while the remaining sales are to credit customers. Of the credit customers, 30% pay their accounts in the month of sale, while the remaining 70% pay their accounts in the month following the month of sale. Projected sales for the next three months are as follows:

	| Month    | Value   |
	| -------- | ------- |
	| October  | $58,000 |
	| November | 65,000  |
	| December | 72,000  |

### Static Budget versus Flexible Budget

14. The production supervisor of the Machining Department for Hagerstown Company agreed to the following monthly static budget for the upcoming year:

    | **Hagerstown Company Machining Department Monthly Production Budget** |            |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
    | Wages                                                        | $2,250,000 |
    | Utilities                                                    | 72,000     |
    | Depreciation                                                 | 36,000     |
    | Total                                                        | $2,358,000 |

    The actual amount spent and the actual units produced in the first three months in the Machining Department were as follows:

    |      | Amount Spent | Units Produced |
    | ---- | ------------ | -------------- |
    | May  | $1,600,000   | 40,000         |
    | June | 1,950,000    | 48,000         |
    | July | 2,200,000    | 52,000         |

    The Machining Department supervisor has been very pleased with this performance because actual expenditures for May–July have been significantly less than the monthly static budget of $2,358,000. However, the plant manager believes that the budget should not remain fixed for every month but should “flex” or adjust to the volume of work that is produced in the Machining Department. Additional budget information for the Machining Department is as follows:

    | item                               | Value  |
    | ---------------------------------- | ------ |
    | Wages per hour                     | $25.00 |
    | Utility cost per direct labor hour | $0.80  |
    | Direct labor hours per unit        | 1.5    |
    | Planned monthly unit production    | 60,000 |

    1. Prepare a flexible budget for the actual units produced for May, June, and July in the Machining Department. Assume depreciation is a fixed cost. If required, use per unit amounts carried out to two decimal places.

         | Utility costs per hour                                       | $0.80         | $0.80         | $0.80         |
         | Total utilities                                              | $48,000.00    | $57,600.00    | $62,400.00    |

    2. Compare the flexible budget with the actual expenditures for the first three months.

       - |                                   | May           | June          | July          |
         | --------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
         | Total flexible budget             | $1,584,000.00 | $1,893,600.00 | $2,048,400.00 |
         | Actual cost                       | $1,600,000.00 | $1,950,000.00 | $2,200,000.00 |
         | Excess of actual cost over budget | $16,000.00    | $56,400.00    | $151,600.00   |

       1. The Machining Department has performed better than originally thought.
          - **No**
       2. The department is spending more than would be expected.

7. Miller and Sons' static budget for 10,000 units of production includes \$50,000 for direct materials, \$44,000 for direct labor, variable utilities of \$5,000, and supervisor salaries of \$24,000. A flexible budget for 12,000 units of production would show **direct materials of \$60,000, direct labor of ​\$52,800, utilities of \$6,000, and supervisor salaries of \$24,000**.

8. At the beginning of the period, the Assembly Department budgeted direct labor of \$110,000, direct materials of ​\$170,000, and fixed factory overhead of \$28,000 for 8,000 hours of production. The department actually completed 10,000 hours of production. The appropriate total budget for the department, assuming it uses flexible budgeting, is $(10000*\frac{110000}{8000})+(10000*\frac{170000}{8000})+28000=378000$

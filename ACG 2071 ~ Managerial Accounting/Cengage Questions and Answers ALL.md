7. At the end of May, Bergan Company had completed Jobs 200 and 305. Job 200 is for 2,390 units, and Job 305 is for 2,053 units.

      The following data relate to these two jobs:

      On May 7, Bergan Company purchased on account 10,000 units of raw materials at \$8 per unit. During May, raw materials were requisitioned for production as follows: 7,500 units for Job 200 at \$8 per unit and 1,480 units for Job 305 at ​\$5 per unit.

      During May, Bergan Company accumulated 2,500 hours of direct labor costs on Job 200 and 3,000 hours on Job 305. The total direct labor was incurred at a rate of \$28 per direct labor hour for Job 200 and ​\$24 per direct labor hour for Job 305.

      Bergan Company estimates that total factory overhead costs will be \$620,000 for the year. Direct labor hours are estimated to be 80,000.

      1. Determine the balance on the *job cost sheets* for Jobs 200 and 305 at the end of May.

         - | Job     | Balance at the end of May                                    |
           | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
           | Job 200 | $8*7500=60000$<br />$28*2500=70000$<br />$7.75*2500=19375$<br />$60000+70000+19375=149375$ |
           | Job 305 | $5*1480=7400$<br />$24*3000=72000$<br />$7.75*3000=23250$<br />$7400+72000+23250=102650$ |

      2. Determine the cost per unit for Jobs 200 and 305 at the end of May. If required, round your answers to two decimal places.

         - | Job     | Cost per unit at the end of May |
           | ------- | ------------------------------- |
           | Job 200 | $\frac{149375}{2390}=\$62.50$   |
           | Job 305 | $\frac{102650}{2053}=\$50.00$   |

8. Pine Creek Company completed 200,000 units during the year at a cost of \$3,000,000. The beginning finished goods inventory was 25,000 units at ​\$310,000. Determine the cost of goods sold for 210,000 units, assuming a FIFO cost flow.

      - Beginning inventory: $\frac{\$310000}{25000}=\$12.40$
        Completed Units: $\frac{$3000000}{200000}=\$15$
        Cost of goods: $(25000*12.40)+[(210000-25000)*25]=310000+2775000=\$3085000$

9. Ginocera Inc. is a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of custom gourment kitchen knives. A new kitchen knife series called the Kitchen Ninja was released for production in early 20Y8. In January, the company spent \$600,000 to develop a late-night advertising infomercial for the new product. During 20Y8, the company spent an additional \$1,400,000 promoting the product through these infomercials, and \$800,000 in legal costs. The knives were ready for manufacture on January 1, 20Y8.

      Ginocera uses a job order cost system to accumulate costs associated with the Kitchen Ninja Knife. The unit direct materials cost for the knife is:

      | Line item                                              |       |
      | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
      | Hardened steel blanks (used for knife shaft and blade) | $4.00 |
      | Wood (for handle)                                      | 1.50  |
      | Packaging                                              | 0.50  |

      The production process is straightforward. First, the hardened steel blanks, which are purchased directly from a raw material supplier, are stamped into a single piece of metal that includes both the blade and the shaft. The stamping machine requires one hour per 250 knives.

      After the knife shafts are stamped, they are brought to an assembly area where an employee attaches the handle to the shaft and packs the knife into a decorative box. The direct labor cost is \$0.50 per unit.

      The knives are sold to stores. Each store is given promotional materials, such as posters and aisle displays. Promotional materials cost \$60 per store. In addition, shipping costs average ​\$0.20 per knife.

      Total completed production was 1,200,000 units during the year. Other information is as follows:

      | Line item                            |           |
      | ------------------------------------ | --------- |
      | Number of customers (stores)         | 60,000    |
      | Number of knives sold                | 1,120,000 |
      | Wholesale price (to store) per knife | $16       |

      Factory overhead cost is applied to jobs at the rate of \$800 per stamping machine hour after the knife blanks are stamped. There were an additional 25,000 stamped knives, handles, and cases in process and waiting to be assembled on December 31, 20Y8.
      *In your computations, if required, round interim per unit costs to two decimal places.*

10. Technology Accessories Inc. is a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of accessories for consumer electronic products. Early in 20Y3, the company began production of a leather cover for tablet computers, called the iLeather. The cover is made of stitched leather with a velvet interior and fits snugly around most tablet computers. In January, \$750,000 was spent on developing marketing and advertising materials. For the first six months of 20Y3, the company spent an additional ​\$1,400,000 promoting the iLeather. The product was ready for manufacture on January 21, 20Y3.

      Technology Accessories Inc. uses a *job order cost system* to accumulate costs for the iLeather. Direct materials unit costs for the iLeather are as follows:

    | Item      | Value             |
    | --------- | ----------------- |
    | Leather   | $10.00            |
    | Velvet    | 5.00              |
    | Packaging | <u>0.40</u>       |
    | Total     | <u>**$15.40**</u> |

      The actual production process for the iLeather is fairly straightforward. First, leather is brought to a cutting and stitching machine. The machine cuts the leather and stitches an exterior edge into the product. The machine requires one hour per 125 iLeathers.

      After the iLeather is cut and stitched, it is brought to assembly, where assembly personnel affix the velvet interior and pack the iLeather for shipping. The direct labor cost for this work is \$0.50 per unit.

      The completed packages are then sold to retail outlets through a sales force. The sales force is compensated by a 20% commission on the wholesale price for all sales.

      Total completed production was 500,000 units during the year. Other information is as follows:

    | Item                                  | Value   |

7. Poehling Medical Center has a single operating room that is used by local physicians to perform surgical procedures. The cost of using the operating room is accumulated by each patient procedure and includes the direct materials costs (drugs and medical devices), physician surgical time, and operating room overhead. On January 1 of the current year, the annual operating room overhead is estimated to be:

   | Item                          | Value               |
   | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
   | Disposable supplies           | \$179300            |
   | Depreciation expense          | 32300               |
   | Utilities                     | 18800               |
   | Nurse salaries                | 269300              |
   | Technician wages              | <u>88300</u>        |
   | Total operating room overhead | <u>**\$588000**</u> |

   The overhead costs will be assigned to procedures, based on the number of surgical room hours. Poehling Medical Center expects to use the operating room an average of eight hours per day, seven days per week. In addition, the operating room will be shut down two weeks per year for general repairs.

   1. Determine the predetermined operating room overhead rate for the year.
         - $\frac{588000}{8*7*50}=\$210$ per hour
   2. Bill Harris had a 7-hour procedure on January 22. How much operating room overhead would be charged to his procedure, using the rate determined in part (a)?

   3. During January, the operating room was used 186 hours. The actual overhead costs incurred for January were \$38,200. Determine the *overapplied operating overhead* or *underapplied operating overhead* for the period.
         - $38200-(210*186)=860$ **overapplied**

8. Technology Accessories Inc. is a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of accessories for consumer electronic products. Early in 20Y3, the company began production of a leather cover for tablet computers, called the iLeather. The cover is made of stitched leather with a velvet interior and fits snugly around most tablet computers. In January, \$779,000 was spent on developing marketing and advertising materials. For the first six months of 20Y3, the company spent an additional ​\$1,405,000 promoting the iLeather. The product was ready for manufacture on January 21, 20Y3.

   Technology Accessories Inc. uses a job order cost system to accumulate costs for the iLeather. Direct materials unit costs for the iLeather are as follows:
       
   | Item      | Value  |
   | --------- | ------ |
   | Leather   | $10.00 |
   | Velvet    | 5.00   |
   | Packaging | 0.40   |
   | Total     | $15.40 |
   
   The actual production process for the iLeather is fairly straightforward. First, leather is brought to a cutting and stitching machine. The machine cuts the leather and stitches an exterior edge into the product. The machine requires one hour per 130 iLeathers.
   
   After the iLeather is cut and stitched, it is brought to assembly, where assembly personnel affix the velvet interior and pack the iLeather for shipping. The direct labor cost for this work is \$0.50 per unit.
   
   The completed packages are then sold to retail outlets through a sales force. The sales force is compensated by a 20% commission on the wholesale price for all sales.
   Total completed production was 540,000 units during the year. Other information is as follows:
       
   
   | Item                                  | Value   |
   | ------------------------------------- | ------- |
   | Number of iLeather units sold in 20Y3 | 500,000 |
   | Wholesale price per unit              | $40     |
   
   Factory overhead cost is applied to jobs at the rate of \$1,300 per machine hour. There were an additional 21,000 cut and stitched iLeathers waiting to be assembled on December 31, 20Y3.
   *In your computations, if required, round interim per unit costs to two decimal places and final answers to the nearest whole dollar.*

8. Kraus Steel Company has two departments, Casting and Rolling. In the Rolling Department, ingots from the Casting Department are rolled into steel sheet. The Rolling Department received 4,000 tons from the Casting Department in October. During October, the Rolling Department completed 3,900 tons, including 200 tons of work in process on October 1. The ending work in process inventory on October 31 was 300 tons.

   How many tons were started and completed during October?

   - $3900-200=3700$

9. The Rolling Department of Kraus Steel Company had 200 tons in beginning work in process inventory (60% complete) on October 1. During October, 3,900 tons were completed. The ending work in process inventory on October 31 was 300 tons (25% complete).

   What are the total equivalent units for direct materials for October if materials are added at the beginning of the process?

   - $(3900-200)+(300*100\%)=4000$

10. The Rolling Department of Kraus Steel Company had 200 tons in beginning work in process inventory (60% complete) on October 1. During October, 3,900 tons were completed. The ending work in process inventory on October 31 was 300 tons (25% complete).

    What are the total equivalent units for conversion costs?

    - $3900-(.6*200)+(.25*300)=3855$

11. The cost of direct materials transferred into the Rolling Department of Kraus Company is \$3,000,000. The conversion cost for the period in the Rolling Department is ​\$462,600. The total equivalent units for direct materials and conversion are 4,000 tons and 3,855 tons, respectively.

    Determine the direct materials and conversion costs per equivalent unit.

    - Direct materials cost per equivalent unit: $\frac{3000000}{4000}=750$
      Conversion cost per equivalent unit: $\frac{462600}{3855}=120$

12. The *costs per equivalent unit* of direct materials and conversion in the Rolling Department of Kraus Steel Company are \$750 and ​\$120, respectively. The equivalent units to be assigned costs are as follows:

    | Equivalent Units –>                    | Direct Materials | Conversion      |
    | -------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
    | Inventory in process, October 1        | 0                | 80              |
    | Started and completed during October   | <u>3700</u>      | <u>3700</u>     |
    | Transferred out of Rolling (Completed) | 3700             | 3780            |
    | Inventory in process, October 31       | <u>300</u>       | <u>75</u>       |
    | Total units to be assigned costs       | <u>**4000**</u>  | <u>**3855**</u> |

    The beginning work in process inventory on October 1 had a cost of $163,800. Determine the cost of completed and transferred-out production, the ending work in process inventory, and the total costs assigned by the Rolling Department.

    - Completed and transferred-out production: $(750*3700)+(120*3780)+163800=3392400$
      Inventory in process, October 31: $(750*300)+(120*75)=234000$
      Total costs assigned by the Rolling Department: $(750*4000)+(120*3855)+163800=3626400$

13. The costs of materials consumed in producing good units in the Forming Department of Thomas Company were \$76,000 and ​\$77,350 for September and October, respectively. The number of equivalent units produced in September and October was 800 tons and 850 tons, respectively. Evaluate the change in the cost of materials between the two months.

    - Material cost per ton, September: $\frac{76000}{800}=95$
      Material cost per ton, October: $\frac{77350}{850}=91$
      The cost of materials **decreased** by $95-91=4$ per ton between September and October

8. Radford Inc. manufactures a sugar product by a continuous process, involving three production departments—Refining, Sifting, and Packing. Assume that records indicate that direct materials, direct labor, and applied factory overhead for the first department, Refining, were \$641,900, \$224,700, and \$147,600, respectively. Also, work in process in the Refining Department at the beginning of the period totaled ​\$35,900, and work in process at the end of the period totaled \$44,300.

9. Technology Accessories Inc. is a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of accessories for consumer electronic products. Early in 20Y3, the company began production of a leather cover for tablet computers, called the iLeather. The cover is made of stitched leather with a velvet interior and fits snugly around most tablet computers. In January, \$775,000 was spent on developing marketing and advertising materials. For the first six months of 20Y3, the company spent an additional ​\$1,402,000 promoting the iLeather. The product was ready for manufacture on January 21, 20Y3.

   Technology Accessories Inc. uses a job order cost system to accumulate costs for the iLeather. Direct materials unit costs for the iLeather are as follows:

   | Item      | Value           |
   | --------- | --------------- |
   | Leather   | 10              |
   | Velvet    | 5               |
   | Packaging | <u>.4</u>       |
   | Total     | <u>**15.4**</u> |

   The actual production process for the iLeather is fairly straightforward. First, leather is brought to a cutting and stitching machine. The machine cuts the leather and stitches an exterior edge into the product. The machine requires one hour per 130 iLeathers.

   After the iLeather is cut and stitched, it is brought to assembly, where assembly personnel affix the velvet interior and pack the iLeather for shipping. The direct labor cost for this work is \$0.50 per unit.

   The completed packages are then sold to retail outlets through a sales force. The sales force is compensated by a 20% commission on the wholesale price for all sales.

   Total completed production was 500,000 units during the year. Other information is as follows:

   | Item                                  | Value  |
   | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
   | Number of ILeather units sold in 20Y3 | 460000 |
   | Wholesale price per unit              | 40     |

   Factory overhead cost is applied to jobs at the rate of \$1,300 per machine hour. There were an additional 22,000 cut and stitched iLeathers waiting to be assembled on December 31, 20Y3.

   *In your computations, if required, round interim per unit costs to two decimal places and final answers to the nearest whole dollar.*

   1. Prepare an annual income statement for the iLeather product.

   2. Determine the balances in the finished goods and work in process inventories for the iLeather product on December 31, 20Y3.

      - | Type            | Value                        |
        | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
        | Finished goods  | $40000*\$25.90=\$1036000$    |
        | Work in process | $22000*(15.4+\$10)=\$558800$ |

### Product Costing and Decision Analysis for a Service Company

6. Pleasant Stay Medical Inc. wishes to determine its product costs. Pleasant Stay offers a variety of medical procedures (operations) that are considered its “products.” The overhead has been separated into three major activities. The annual estimated activity costs and activity bases follow:

   | Activity                 | Budgeted Activity Cost | Activity Base          |
   | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
   | Scheduling and admitting | 432000                 | Number of patients     |
   | Housekeeping             | 4212000                | Number of patient days |
   | Nursing                  | <u>5376000</u>         | Weighted care unit     |
   | Total costs              | <u>**10020000**</u>    |                        |

   Total “patient days” are determined by multiplying the number of patients by the average length of stay in the hospital. A weighted care unit (wcu) is a measure of nursing effort used to care for patients. There were 192,000 weighted care units estimated for the year. In addition, Pleasant Stay estimated 6,000 patients and 27,000 patient days for the year. (The average patient is expected to have a a little more than a four-day stay in the hospital.)

   During a portion of the year, Pleasant Stay collected patient information for three selected procedures, as follows:

   | Activity-Base Usage –> | Procedure A      | Procedure B     | Procedure C      |
   | ---------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
   | Number of patients     | 280              | 650             | 1200             |
   | Average length of stay | 6                | 5               | 4                |
   | Patient Days           | <u>1680</u>      | <u>3250</u>     | <u>4800</u>      |
   | Weighted care units    | <u>**19200**</u> | <u>**6000**</u> | <u>**24000**</u> |

   Private insurance reimburses the hospital for these activities at a fixed daily rate of \$406 per patient day for all three procedures.

   1. Determine the activity rates

   - **False**

4. Activity-based costing can be used to allocate period costs to various products that the company sells.

   - **True**

5. Which of the following does *not* rely on managerial decisions involving accurate product costing?

   - **product constraints**

6. Ramapo Company produces two products, Blinks and Dinks. They are manufactured in two departments, Fabrication and Assembly. Data for the products and departments are listed below.

   | Product | Number of Units | Labor Hours per Unit | Machine Hours per Unit |
   | ------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
   | Blinks  | 1000            | 4                    | 5                      |
   | Dinks   | 2000            | 2                    | 8                      |

   All of the machine hours take place in the Fabrication Department, which has an estimated overhead of \$84,000. All of the labor hours take place in the Assembly Department, which has an estimated total overhead of \$72,000.

   Ramapo Company uses a single plantwide overhead rate to apply all factory overhead costs. The single plantwide rate, if it is based on machine hours instead of labor hours, is $\frac{84000+72000}{(1000*5)+(2000*8)}=7.43$

7. Blue Ridge Marketing Inc. manufactures two products, A and B. Presently, the company uses a single plantwide factory overhead rate for allocating overhead to products. However, management is considering moving to a multiple department rate system for allocating overhead. The following table presents information about estimated overhead and direct labor hours.

   |                      | Overhead | Direct Labor Hours | Product A | Product B |
   | -------------------- | -------- | ------------------ | --------- | --------- |
   | Painting department  | 248000   | 10000              | 16        | 4         |
   | Finishing department | 72000    | 10000              | 4         | 16        |

## Practice Exercises

### Break-Even Analysis

1. Media outlets such as ESPN and FOX Sports often have websites that provide in-depth coverage of news and events. Portions of these websites are restricted to members who pay a monthly subscription to gain access to exclusive news and commentary.

   These websites typically offer a free trial period to introduce viewers to the websites. Assume that during a recent fiscal year, [ESPN.com](https://www.espn.com/) spent $4,200,000 on a promotional campaign for the [ESPN.com](https://www.espn.com/) websites that offered two free months of service for new subscribers. In addition, assume the following information:

   | Number of months an average new customer stays with the service<br/>(including the two free months) | 14 months |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
   | Revenue per month per customer subscription                  | 10        |

    3. Explain the reason for the difference in the amount of operating income reported in (1) and (2).

       - The operating income reported under **absorption** costing exceeds the operating income reported under **variable** costing, due to **fixed** manufacturing costs that are deferred to a future month under **absorption** costing.

### Analyzing Income under Absorption and Variable Costing

16. Variable manufacturing costs are \$126 per unit, and fixed manufacturing costs are ​\$157,500. Sales are estimated to be 10,000 units.

    If an amount is zero, enter "0".

    1. How much would absorption costing operating income differ between a plan to produce 10,000 units and a plan to produce 15,000 units?
       - $10000*(\frac{157500}{10000}-\frac{157500}{15000})=52500$
    2. How much would variable costing operating income differ between the two production plans?
       - $0$ because there would be no difference in variable costing operating income.

### Contribution Margin by Segment

17. The following information is for LaPlanche Industries Inc.:

    |                         | East  | West  |
    | ----------------------- | ----- | ----- |
    | Sales volume (units):   |       |       |
    | Product XX              | 45000 | 38000 |
    | Product YY              | 60000 | 50000 |
    | Sales price:            |       |       |
    | Product XX              | 700   | 660   |
    | Product YY              | 728   | 720   |
    | Variable cost per unit: |       |       |
    | Product XX              | 336   | 336   |
    | Product YY              | 360   | 360   |

    1. Determine the contribution margin for the Product YY.
       - $[60000*(728-360)]+[50000*(720-360)]=40080000$
    2. Determine the contribution margin for the West Region.
       - $[38000*(660-336)]+[50000*(720-360)]=30312000$

### Inventory Valuation under Absorption Costing and Variable Costing

18. At the end of the first year of operations, 21,500 units remained in the finished goods inventory. The unit manufacturing costs during the year were as follows:

    | Item                      | Value |
    | ------------------------- | ----- |
    | Direct materials          | 30    |
    | Direct labor              | 18    |
    | Fixed factory overhead    | 22    |
    | Variable factory overhead | 14    |

    Determine the cost of the finished goods inventory reported on the balance sheet under (a) the absorption costing concept and (b) the variable costing concept.

    - Absorption costing: $21500*(30+18+22+14)=1806000$
      Variable costing: $21500*(30+18+14)=1333000$

### Variable and Absorption Costing–Three Products

19. Winslow Inc. manufactures and sells three types of shoes. The income statements prepared under the absorption costing method for the three shoes are as follows:

    | Product Income Statements–Absorption Costing For the Year Ended December 31, 20Y1 | Cross Training Shoes | Golf Shoes         | Running Shoes       |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
    | Revenues                                                     | 5800000              | 6900000            | 4200000             |
    | Cost of goods sold                                           | <u>(3016000)</u>     | <u>(3381000)</u>   | <u>(2814000)</u>    |
    | Gross profit                                                 | 2784000              | 3519000            | 1386000             |
    | Selling and administrative expenses                          | <u>(2436000)</u>     | <u>(2484000)</u>   | <u>(2142000)</u>    |
    | Operating Income                                             | <u>**348000**</u>    | <u>**1035000**</u> | <u>**(756000)**</u> |

    In addition, you have determined the following information with respect to allocated fixed costs:

    |                                     | Cross Training Shoes | Golf Shoes | Running Shoes |
    | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
    | Fixed costs:                        |                      |            |               |
    | Cost of goods sold                  | 928000               | 897000     | 798000        |
    | Selling and administrative expenses | 696000               | 828000     | 588000        |

    These fixed costs are used to support all three product lines and will not change with the elimination of any one product. In addition, you have determined that the effects of inventory may be ignored.

    The management of the company has deemed the profit performance of the running shoe line as unacceptable. As a result, it has decided to eliminate the running shoe line. Management does not expect to be able to increase sales in the other two lines. However, as a result of eliminating the running shoe line, management expects the profits of the company to increase by \$756,000.

    1. Are management’s decision and conclusions correct?

       - Management’s decision and conclusion are **incorrect** . The profit **will not** be improved because the fixed costs used in manufacturing and selling running shoes **will not** be avoided if the line is eliminated.

    2. Prepare a variable costing income statement for the three products. Enter a net loss as a negative number using a minus sign.

       - | Variable Costing Income Statements–Three Product Lines For the Year Ended December 31, 20Y1 | Cross Training Shoes | Golf Shoes | Running Shoes |
         | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
         | Revenues                                                     | 5800000              | 6900000    | 4200000       |
         | Variable cost of goods sold                                  | -2088000             | -2484000   | -2016000      |
         | Manufacturing margin                                         | 3712000              | 4416000    | 2184000       |
         | Variable selling and administrative expenses                 | -1740000             | -1656000   | -1554000      |
         | Contribution margin                                          | 1972000              | 2760000    | 630000        |
         | Fixed costs:                                                 |                      |            |               |
         | Fixed manufacturing costs                                    | -928000              | -897000    | -798000       |
         | Fixed selling and administrative expenses                    | -696000              | -828000    | -588000       |
         | Total fixed costs                                            | -1624000             | -1725000   | 1386000       |
         | Operating income (loss)                                      | 348000               | 1035000    | -756000       |

    3. Use the report in (b) to determine the profit impact of eliminating the running shoe line, assuming no other changes.

       - If the running shoe line were eliminated, then the contribution margin of the product line would **be eliminated** and the fixed costs **would not** be eliminated. Thus, the profit of the company would actually **decline** by **630000**. Management should keep the line and attempt to improve the profitability of the product by **increasing** prices, **increasing** volume, or **reducing** costs.

### Variable Costing

20. Marley Company has the following information for March:

    | Item                                         | Value  |
    | -------------------------------------------- | ------ |
    | Sales                                        | 912000 |
    | Variable cost of goods sold                  | 474000 |
    | Fixed manufacturing costs                    | 82000  |
    | Variable selling and administrative expenses | 238100 |
    | Fixed selling and administrative expenses    | 54700  |

    Determine the following for Marley Company for the month of March:

    1. Manufacturing margin: $912000-474000=438000$
    2. Contribution margin: $438000-238100=199900$
    3. Operating income: $199900-82000-54700=63200$

### Variable Costing–Production Exceeds Sales

21. Fixed manufacturing costs are \$44 per unit, and variable manufacturing costs are ​\$100 per unit. Production was 67,200 units, while sales were 50,400 units.
    1. Determine whether variable costing operating income is less than or greater than absorption costing operating income.
       - **Variable costing operating income is less than absorption costing.**
    2. Determine the difference in variable costing and absorption costing operating income.
       - $16800*44=739200$

### Variable Costing–Sales Exceed Production

22. The beginning inventory is 52,800 units. All of the units that were manufactured during the period and 52,800 units of the beginning inventory were sold. The beginning inventory fixed manufacturing costs are \$14.70 per unit, and variable manufacturing costs are ​\$30 per unit.
    1. Determine whether variable costing operating income is less than or greater than absorption costing operating income.
       - **Variable costing operating income is greater than absorption costing.**
    2. Determine the difference in variable costing and absorption costing operating income.
       - $52800*14.7=776160$

5. A business operated at 100% of capacity during its first month and incurred the following costs:

   | Item                            | Value        | Value  |
   | ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------ |
   | Production costs (20000 units): |              |        |
   | Direct materials                | 180000       |        |
   | Direct labor                    | 240000       |        |
   | Variable factory overhead       | 280000       |        |
   | Operating expenses:             |              |        |
   | Variable operating expenses     | 130000       |        |
   | Fixed operating expenses        | <u>50000</u> | 180000 |

   If 1,600 units remain unsold at the end of the month, the amount of inventory that would be reported on the variable costing balance sheet is

   - $1600*\frac{180000+240000+280000}{20000}=56000$

6. A business operated at 100% of capacity during its first month and incurred the following costs:

   | Item                            | Value        | Value  |
   | ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------ |
   | Production costs (10000 units): |              |        |
   | Direct materials                | 80000        |        |
   | Direct labor                    | 120000       |        |
   | Variable factory overhead       | 140000       |        |
   | Fixed factory overhead          | <u>40000</u> | 380000 |
   | Operating expenses:             |              |        |

   | Fixed operating expenses        | <u>25000</u> | 90000  |

   If 600 units remain unsold at the end of the month, the amount of inventory that would be reported on the absorption costing balance sheet is: $\frac{80000+120000+140000+40000}{10000}*600=22800$

7. A business operated at 100% of capacity during its first month and incurred the following costs:

   | Item                           | Value       | Value  |
   | ------------------------------ | ----------- | ------ |
   | Production costs (5000 units): |             |        |
   | Direct materials               | 70000       |        |
   | Direct labor                   | 20000       |        |
   | Variable factory overhead      | 10000       |        |

   | Operating expenses:            |             |        |
   | Variable operating expenses    | 17000       |        |
   | Fixed operating expenses       | <u>1000</u> | 18000  |

   If 1,000 units remain unsold at the end of the month and sales total \$150,000 for the month, the amount of contribution margin that would be reported on the variable costing income statement is $150000-[(\frac{70000+20000+10000}{5000}*5000)-(\frac{70000+20000+10000}{5000}*1000)]-17000=53000$

8. A business operated at 100% of capacity during its first month and incurred the following costs:

   | Item                          | Value        | Value  |
   | ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------ |
   | Sales (103 units)             |              | 484100 |
   | Production costs (129 units): |              |        |

   | Direct labor                  | 16734        |        |
   | Variable factory overhead     | 29284        |        |
   | Fixed factory overhead        | <u>27890</u> | 139449 |
   | Operating expenses:           |              |        |
   | Variable operating expenses   | 6053         |        |
   | Fixed operating expenses      | <u>3513</u>  | 9566   |

   The amount of operating income that would be reported on the absorption costing income statement is $484100-[(\frac{65541+16734+29284+27890}{129}*129)-(\frac{65541+16734+29284+27890}{129}*(129-103))]-9566=363191$

9. Under which inventory costing method could increases or decreases in operating income be misinterpreted to be the result of operating efficiencies or inefficiencies?

   - **only absorption costing**

10. Jake Entertainment Corporation has three segments with revenue, operating income, and depreciation and amortization information (in millions) as follows:

    | Segment    | Revenue         | Operating Income | Depreciation and Amortization |
    | ---------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
    | Film       | 5000            | 1500             | 525                           |
    | Theme Park | 1000            | 320              | 112                           |
    | Video Game | <u>500</u>      | <u>175</u>       | <u>53</u>                     |
    | Totals     | <u>**6500**</u> | <u>**1995**</u>  | <u>**690**</u>                |

    The EBITDA for the Theme Park segment is $320000000+112000000=432000000$

### Absorption and Variable Costing Income Statements

11. During the first month of operations ended July 31, YoSan Inc. manufactured 10,100 flat panel televisions, of which 9,500 were sold. Operating data for the month are summarized as follows:

    | Item                                 |               |         |

    3. Explain the reason for the difference in the amount of operating income reported in (1) and (2).

       - The operating income reported under **absorption** costing exceeds the operating income reported under **variable** costing, due to **fixed** manufacturing costs that are deferred to a future month under **absorption** costing.

### Analyzing Income under Absorption and Variable Costing

12. Variable manufacturing costs are \$90 per unit, and fixed manufacturing costs are ​\$69,300. Sales are estimated to be 6,300 units.

    If an amount is zero, enter "0". *Round intermediate calculations to the nearest cent and your final answers to the nearest dollar.*

    1. How much would absorption costing operating income differ between a plan to produce 6,300 units and a plan to produce 7,700 units?
       - $6300*(\frac{69300}{6300}-\frac{69300}{7700})=12600$
    2. How much would variable costing operating income differ between the two production plans?
       - $0$

### Contribution Margin by Segment

13. The following data are for Flat Bed Apparel:

    |                         | East | West |
    | ----------------------- | ---- | ---- |
    | Sales volume (units):   |      |      |
    | Product XX              | 6300 | 7100 |
    | Product YY              | 4200 | 6300 |
    | Sales price:            |      |      |
    | Product XX              | 11   | 9    |
    | Product YY              | 15   | 17   |
    | Variable cost per unit: |      |      |
    | Product XX              | 7    | 7    |
    | Product YY              | 9    | 9    |

    1. Determine the contribution margin for Product YY.
       - $[4200*(15-9)]+[6300*(17-9)]=75600$
    2. Determine the contribution margin for the West Region.
       - $[7100*(9-7)]+[6300*(17-9)]=64600$

### Inventory Valuation under Absorption Costing and Variable Costing

14. At the end of the first year of operations, 6,100 units remained in the finished goods inventory. The unit manufacturing costs during the year were as follows:

    | Item                      | Value |
    | ------------------------- | ----- |
    | Direct materials          | 29.4  |
    | Direct labor              | 16.9  |
    | Fixed factory overhead    | 6.8   |
    | Variable factory overhead | 6     |

    Determine the cost of the finished goods inventory reported on the balance sheet under (a) the absorption costing concept and (b) the variable costing concept.

    - Absorption costing: $6100*(29.4+16.9+6.8+6)=360510$
      Variable costing: $6100*(29.4+16.9+6)=319030$

### Variable and Absorption Costing—Three Products

15. Winslow Inc. manufactures and sells three types of shoes. The income statements prepared under the absorption costing method for the three shoes are as follows:

    | Product Income Statements–Absorption Costing For the Year Ended December 31, 20Y1 | Cross Training Shoes | Golf Shoes       | Running Shoes      |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
    | Revenues                                                     | 447100               | 268300           | 228100             |
    | Cost of goods sold                                           | <u>(232500)</u>      | <u>(131500)</u>  | <u>(152800)</u>    |
    | Gross profit                                                 | 214600               | 136800           | 75300              |
    | Selling and administrative expenses                          | <u>(184600)</u>      | <u>(98500)</u>   | <u>(125800)</u>    |
    | Operating Income                                             | <u>**30000**</u>     | <u>**38300**</u> | <u>**(50500)**</u> |

    In addition, you have determined the following information with respect to allocated fixed costs:

    |                                     | Cross Training Shoes | Golf Shoes | Running Shoes |
    | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
    | Fixed costs:                        |                      |            |               |
    | Cost of goods sold                  | 71500                | 34900      | 31900         |
    | Selling and administrative expenses | 53700                | 32200      | 31900         |

    These fixed costs are used to support all three product lines and will not change with the elimination of any one product. In addition, you have determined that the effects of inventory may be ignored.

    The management of the company has deemed the profit performance of the running shoe line as unacceptable. As a result, it has decided to eliminate the running shoe line. Management does not expect to be able to increase sales in the other two lines. However, as a result of eliminating the running shoe line, management expects the profits of the company to increase by \$50,500.

    1. Are management’s decision and conclusions correct?

       -  Management’s decision and conclusion are **incorrect** . The profit **will not** be improved because the fixed costs used in manufacturing and selling running shoes **will not** be avoided if the line is eliminated.

    2. Prepare a variable costing income statement for the three products. Enter a net loss as a negative number using a minus sign.

       - | Variable Costing Income Statements–Three Product Lines For the Year Ended December 31, 20Y1 | Cross Training Shoes   | Golf Shoes            | Running Shoes          |

         | Variable selling and administrative expenses                 | $184600-53700=130900$  | $98500-32200=66300$   | $125800-31900=93900$   |
         | Contribution margin                                          | $286100-130900=155200$ | $171700-66300=105400$ | $107200-93900=13300$   |
         | Fixed costs:                                                 |                        |                       |                        |
         | Fixed manufacturing costs                                    | $71500$                | 34900                 | $31900$                |
         | Fixed selling and administrative expenses                    | $53700$                | 32200                 | $31900$                |
         | Total fixed costs                                            | $71500+53700=125200$   | $34900+32200=67100$   | $31900+31900=63800$    |
         | Operating income (loss)                                      | $155200-125200=30000$  | $105400-67100=38300$  | $13300-63800=-50500$   |

    3. Use the report in (b) to determine the profit impact of eliminating the running shoe line, assuming no other changes.

       - If the running shoes line were eliminated, then the contribution margin of the product line would **be eliminated** and the fixed costs **would not** be eliminated. Thus, the profit of the company would actually **decline** by $13300$. Management should keep the line and attempt to improve the profitability of the product by **increasing** prices, **increasing** volume, or **reducing** costs.

### Variable Costing

16. Marsich Company has the following information for July:

    | Item                                         | Value  |
    | -------------------------------------------- | ------ |
    | Sales                                        | 710000 |
    | Variable cost of goods sold                  | 326600 |
    | Fixed manufacturing costs                    | 106500 |
    | Variable selling and administrative expenses | 78100  |
    | Fixed selling and administrative expenses    | 49700  |

    Determine the following for Marsich Company for the month of July:

    1. Manufacturing margin: $710000-326600=383400$
    2. Contribution margin: $383400-78100=305300$
    3. Operating income: $305300-106500-49700=149100$

### Variable Costing–Production Exceeds Sales

17. Fixed manufacturing costs are \$55 per unit, and variable manufacturing costs are ​\$165 per unit. Production was 132,000 units, while sales were 124,080 units.
    1. Determine whether variable costing operating income is less than or greater than absorption costing operating income.
       -  **Variable costing operating income is less than absorption costing.**
    2. Determine the difference in variable costing and absorption costing operating income.
       - $(132000-124080)*55=435600$

### Variable Costing–Sales Exceed Production

18. The beginning inventory is 13,300 units. All of the units that were manufactured during the period and 13,300 units of the beginning inventory were sold. The beginning inventory fixed manufacturing costs are \$47 per unit, and variable manufacturing costs are ​\$96 per unit.
    1. Determine whether variable costing operating income is less than or greater than absorption costing operating income.
       - **Variable costing operating income is greater than absorption costing.**
    2. Determine the difference in variable costing and absorption costing operating income.
       - $13300*47=625100$

   | ----------------------------- | ----------- | ----- |
   | Sales (90 units)              |             | 90000 |
   | Production costs (100 units): |             |       |
   | Direct materials              | 40000       |       |
   | Direct labor                  | 20000       |       |
   | Variable factory overhead     | 2000        |       |
   | Fixed factory overhead        | <u>7000</u> | 69000 |
   | Operating expenses:           |             |       |
   | Variable operating expenses   | 8000        |       |
   | Fixed operating expenses      | <u>1000</u> | 9000  |

   The amount of operating income that would be reported on the absorption costing income statement is $90000-[69000-(\frac{69000}{100}*(100-90))]-9000=18900$

4. A business operated at 100% of capacity during its first month and incurred the following costs:

   | Item                           | Value       | Value  |
   | ------------------------------ | ----------- | ------ |
   | Production costs (5000 units): |             |        |
   | Direct materials               | 70000       |        |
   | Direct labor                   | 20000       |        |
   | Variable factory overhead      | 10000       |        |
   | Fixed factory overhead         | <u>2000</u> | 102000 |
   | Operating expenses:            |             |        |
   | Variable operating expenses    | 17000       |        |
   | Fixed operating expenses       | <u>1000</u> | 18000  |

   If 1,000 units remain unsold at the end of the month and sales total \$150,000 for the month, the amount of contribution margin that would be reported on the variable costing income statement is $150000-[(70000+20000+10000)-(\frac{100000}{5000}*1000)]-17000=53000$

5. In determining cost of goods sold, two alternate costing concepts can be used: absorption costing and variable costing.

   - **True**

6. A business operated at 100% of capacity during its first month and incurred the following costs:

   | Item                          | Value        | Value  |
   | ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------ |
   | Sales (118 units)             |              | 649000 |
   | Production costs (147 units): |              |        |
   | Direct materials              | 87399        |        |
   | Direct labor                  | 22315        |        |
   | Variable factory overhead     | 39051        |        |
   | Fixed factory overhead        | <u>37190</u> | 185955 |
   | Operating expenses:           |              |        |
   | Variable operating expenses   | 6158         |        |
   | Fixed operating expenses      | <u>3721</u>  | 9879   |

   The amount of gross profit that would be reported on the absorption costing income statement is $649000-[(\frac{185955}{147}*147)-(\frac{185955}{147}*(147-118))]=499731$

7. Which of the following is *not* true when determining the selling price for a product?

   - **Variable costing is effective when determining short-run decisions, but absorption costing is only used for long-term pricing policies.**

8. Which of the following terms is commonly used to describe the concept whereby the cost of manufactured products is composed of direct materials cost, direct labor cost, and all factory overhead cost?

   - **absorption costing**

9. A business operated at 100% of capacity during its first month and incurred the following costs:

   | Item                            | Value         | Value  |
   | ------------------------------- | ------------- | ------ |
   | Production costs (20000 units): |               |        |
   | Direct materials                | 180000        |        |
   | Direct labor                    | 240000        |        |
   | Variable factory overhead       | 280000        |        |
   | Fixed factory overhead          | <u>100000</u> | 800000 |
   | Operating expenses:             |               |        |
   | Variable operating expenses     | 130000        |        |
   | Fixed operating expenses        | <u>50000</u>  | 180000 |

   If 1,500 units remain unsold at the end of the month, the amount of inventory that would be reported on the variable costing balance sheet is $\frac{180000+240000+280000}{20000}*1500=52500$

10. It would be acceptable to have the selling price of a product just above the variable costs and expenses of making and selling it in **the short run**.

11. The level of inventory of a manufactured product has increased by 4,000 units during a period. The following data are also available:

    |                                        | **Variable** | **Fixed** |
    | -------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
    | Unit manufacturing costs of the period | $22.00       | $11.00    |
    | Unit operating expenses of the period  | 7.00         | 5.00      |

    The effect on operating income if absorption costing is used rather than variable costing would be a $11*4000=+44000$

12. The amount of income under absorption costing will equal the amount of income under variable costing when units manufactured **equal units sold**.

13. The level of inventory of a manufactured product has increased by 8,000 units during a period. The following data are also available:

    |                                        | **Variable** | **Fixed** |
    | -------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
    | Unit manufacturing costs of the period | $24.00       | $10.00    |
    | Unit operating expenses of the period  | 8.00         | 3.00      |

    The effect on operating income if absorption costing is used rather than variable costing would be a(n) $10*8000=+80000$

14. Management should focus its sales and production efforts on the product or products that will provide the **maximum contribution margin**.

15. A business operated at 100% of capacity during its first month and incurred the following costs:

    | Item                          | Value       | Value |
    | ----------------------------- | ----------- | ----- |
    | Sales (90 units)              |             | 90000 |
    | Production costs (100 units): |             |       |
    | Direct materials              | 40000       |       |
    | Direct labor                  | 20000       |       |
    | Variable factory overhead     | 2000        |       |
    | Fixed factory overhead        | <u>7000</u> | 69000 |
    | Operating expenses:           |             |       |
    | Variable operating expenses   | 8000        |       |
    | Fixed operating expenses      | <u>1000</u> | 9000  |

    The amount of operating income that would be reported on the variable costing income statement is $90000-[(100*\frac{40000+20000+2000}{100})-(10*\frac{40000+20000+2000}{100})]-8000-(7000+1000)=18200$

16. A business operated at 100% of capacity during its first month and incurred the following costs:

    | Item                            | Value       | Value  |
    | ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
    | Production costs (20000 units): |             |        |
    | Direct materials                | 140000      |        |
    | Direct labor                    | 40000       |        |
    | Variable factory overhead       | 20000       |        |
    | Fixed factory overhead          | <u>4000</u> | 204000 |

    | Variable operating expenses     | 34000       |        |
    | Fixed operating expenses        | <u>2000</u> | 36000  |

    If 2,000 units remain unsold at the end of the month and sales total \$300,000 for the month, the amount of operating income reported on the variable costing income statement would be $300000-[(\frac{140000+40000+20000}{10000}*10000)-(\frac{140000+40000+20000}{10000}*2000)]-34000-(4000+2000)=100000$

17. A business operated at 100% of capacity during its first month and incurred the following costs:

    | Item                            | Value        | Value  |
    | ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------ |
    | Production costs (20600 units): |              |        |

    | Fixed operating expenses        | <u>40700</u> | 170500 |

    If 1,700 units remain unsold at the end of the month and sales total $1,140,000 for the month, what would be the amount of income from operations reported on the absorption costing income statement?

    - $1140000-[(\frac{177000+232600+248200+97800}{20600}*20600)-(\frac{177000+232600+248200+97800}{20600}*1700)]-170500=276248$

    | Unit operating expenses of the period  | 4.00         | 1.50      |

    The effect on operating income if absorption costing is used rather than variable costing would be a $6*7000=+42000$

19. A business operated at 100% of capacity during its first month and incurred the following costs:

    | Item                            | Value        | Value  |

### Break-Even Sales

2. Currently, the unit selling price of a product is \$7,520, the unit variable cost is ​\$4,400, and the total fixed costs are \$23,400,000. A proposal is being evaluated to increase the unit selling price to \$8,000.
   1. Compute the current break-even sales (units).
      - $\frac{23400000}{7520-4400}=7500$
   2. Compute the anticipated break-even sales (units), assuming that the unit selling price is increased and all costs remain constant.
      - $\frac{23400000}{8000-4400}=6500$

### Break-Even Sales and Sales Mix for a Service Company

3. Zero Turbulence Airline provides air transportation services between Los Angeles, California, and Kona, Hawaii. A single Los Angeles to Kona round-trip flight has the following operating statistics:

   | Item                                       | Value |
   | ------------------------------------------ | ----- |
   | Fuel                                       | 7,000 |
   | Flight crew salaries                       | 3,200 |
   | Airplane depreciation                      | 3,480 |
   | Variable cost per passenger—business class | 140   |
   | Variable cost per passenger—economy class  | 120   |
   | Round-trip ticket price—business class     | 800   |
   | Round-trip ticket price—economy class      | 300   |

   It is assumed that the fuel, crew salaries, and airplane depreciation are fixed, regardless of the number of seats sold for the round-trip flight.

   1. Compute the break-even number of seats sold on a single round-trip flight for the overall enterprise product, E. Assume that the overall product mix is 10% business class and 90% economy class tickets.
      - $\frac{7000+3200+3480}{[(10\%*800)+(90\%*300)]+[(10\%*140)+(90\%*120)]}=60$
   2. How many business class and economy class seats would be sold at the break-even point?
      - Business class seats at break-even: $60*10\%=6$
        Economy class seats at break-even: $60*90\%=54$

### Contribution Margin and Contribution Margin Ratio

4. For a recent year, *McDonald’s (MCD)* company-owned restaurants had the following sales and expenses (in millions):

   | Item                                          | Value            |
   | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
   | Sales                                         | <u>15,295.0</u>  |
   | Food and packaging                            | (4,896.9)        |
   | Payroll                                       | (4,134.2)        |
   | Occupancy (rent, depreciation, etc.)          | (3,667.7)        |
   | General, selling, and administrative expenses | <u>(2,384.5)</u> |
   |                                               | (15,083.3)       |
   | Operating income                              | <u>**211.7**</u> |

   Assume that the variable costs consist of food and packaging, payroll, and 40% of the general, selling, and administrative expenses.

   1. What is McDonald's contribution margin? *Round to the nearest tenth of a million (one decimal place)*.
      - $15295.0-4896.9-4134.2-(40\%*2384.5)=5310.1$
   2. What is McDonald's contribution margin ratio? *Round to one decimal place.*
      - $\frac{5310.1}{15295}=34.7\%$
   3. How much would operating income increase if same-store sales increased by \$800 million for the coming year, with no change in the contribution margin ratio or fixed costs?*Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a million (one decimal place)*.
      - $800*34.7\%=277.6$

### Multiple Production Department Factory Overhead Rate Method

5. Four Finger Appliance Company manufactures small kitchen appliances. The product line consists of blenders and toaster ovens. Four Finger Appliance presently uses the multiple production department factory overhead rate method. The factory overhead is as follows:

   | Item                     | Value              |
   | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
   | Assembly Department      | 186,000            |
   | Test and Pack Department | <u>120,000</u>     |
   | Total                    | <u>**306,000**</u> |

   The direct labor information for the production of 7,500 units of each product is as follows:

   |              | Assembly Department | Test and Repack Department |
   | ------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
   | Blender      | 750                 | 2,250                      |
   | Toaster oven | <u>2,250</u>        | <u>750</u>                 |
   | Total        | <u>**3,000**</u>    | <u>**3,000**</u>           |

   Four Finger Appliance used direct labor hours to allocate production department factory overhead to products.

   If required, round all per unit answers to the nearest cent.

   1. Determine the two production department factory overhead rates.

      - Assembly department per direct labor hour: $\frac{186000}{3000}=62$
        Test and pack department per direct labor hour: $\frac{120000}{3000}=40$

   2. Determine the total factory overhead and the factory overhead per unit allocated to each product.

      - | Product      | Total Factory Overhead      | Factory Overhead Per Unit  |
        | ------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
        | Blender      | $(750*62)+(2250*40)=136500$ | $\frac{136500}{7500}=18.2$ |
        | Toaster oven | $(2250*62)+(750*40)=169500$ | $\frac{169500}{7500}=22.6$ |

## Exam

1. Dragon Sports Inc. manufactures and sells two products, baseball bats and baseball gloves. The fixed costs are \$336,000, and the sales mix is 40% bats and 60% gloves. The unit selling price and the unit variable cost for each product are as follows:

   | Product | Unit Selling Price | Unit Variable Cost |
   | ------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
   | Bats    | $60                | $50                |
   | Gloves  | 150                | 90                 |

   1. Compute the break-even sales (units) for the overall enterprise product, E.
      - $\frac{336000}{[(60-50)*40\%]+[(150-90)*60\%]}=8400$
   2. How many units of each product, baseball bats and baseball gloves, would be sold at the break-even point?
      - Baseball bats: $8400*40\%=3360$
        Baseball gloves: $8400*60\%=5040$

2. For the current year ended March 31, Cosgrove Company expects fixed costs of \$621,000, a unit variable cost of \$56, and a unit selling price of \$83.

   1. Compute the anticipated break-even sales (units).
      - $\frac{621000}{83-56}=23000$
   2. Compute the sales (units) required to realize operating income of $143,100.
      - $\frac{621000+143100}{83-56}=28300$

3. At the end of the first year of operations, 4,100 units remained in the finished goods inventory. The unit manufacturing costs during the year were as follows:

   | Item                      | Value  |
   | ------------------------- | ------ |
   | Direct materials          | $29.50 |

   | Fixed factory overhead    | 6.70   |
   | Variable factory overhead | 5.90   |

   Determine the cost of the finished goods inventory reported on the balance sheet under (a) the absorption costing concept and (b) the variable costing concept.

   - Absorption costing: $4100*(29.5+17.5+6.7+5.9)=244360$
     Variable costing: $4100*(29.5+17.5+5.9)=216890$

4. The total factory overhead for Bardot Marine Company is budgeted for the year at \$598,500, divided into two departments: Fabrication, ​\$418,500, and Assembly, \$180,000. Bardot Marine manufactures two types of boats: speedboats and bass boats. The speedboats require two direct labor hours in Fabrication and three direct labor hours in Assembly. The bass boats require four direct labor hours in Fabrication and three direct labor hours in Assembly. Each product is budgeted for 3,000 units of production for the year.

   If required, round all per unit answers to the nearest cent.

   1. Determine the total number of budgeted direct labor hours for the year in each department.
      - Fabrication direct labor hours: $(3000*2)+(3000*4)=18000$
        Assembly direct labor hours: $(3000*3)+(3000*3)=18000$
   2. Determine the departmental factory overhead rates for both departments.
      - Fabrication department rate: $\frac{418500}{18000}=23.25$
        Assembly department rate: $\frac{180000}{18000}=10.00$
   3. Determine the factory overhead allocated per unit for each product using the department factory overhead allocation rates.
      - Total factory overhead per speedboat: $(23.25*2)+(10*3)=76.50$
        Total factory overhead per bass boat: $(23.25*4)+(10*3)=123.00$

5. United Merchants Company sells 36,000 units at \$27 per unit. Variable costs are ​\$21.87 per unit, and fixed costs are \$99,700.

   Determine (a) the contribution margin ratio, (b) the unit contribution margin, and (c) operating income.

   1. Contribution margin ratio (Enter as a whole number.)
      - $\frac{27-21.87}{27}=19\%$
   2. Unit contribution margin *(Round to the nearest cent.)*
      - $27-21.87=5.13$
   3. Operating income
      - $(5.13*36000)-99700=84980$

   3. Explain the reason for the difference in the amount of operating income reported in (1) and (2).

      - The operating income reported under **absorption** costing exceeds the operating income reported under **variable** costing, due to **fixed** manufacturing costs that are deferred to a future month under **absorption** costing.

7. Ziegler Inc. has decided to use the high-low method to estimate the total cost and the fixed and variable cost components of the total cost. The data for various levels of production are as follows:

   | Units Produced | Total Costs |
   | -------------- | ----------- |
   | 1,620          | $395,280    |
   | 3,010          | 585,890     |
   | 5,220          | 614,880     |

   1. Determine the variable cost per unit and the total fixed cost.
      - Variable cost (Round to the nearest dollar.): $\frac{614880-395280}{5220-1620}=61$
        Total fixed cost: $614880-(61*5220)=296460$
   2. Based on part (a), estimate the total cost for 2,460 units of production.
      - $296460+(61*2460)=446520$

5. Tobin’s Frozen Pizza Inc. has determined from its production budget the following estimated production volumes for 12'' and 16'' frozen pizzas for November:

   |                            | 12" Pizza | 16" Pizza |
   | -------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
   | Budgeted production volume | 70,000    | 50,000    |

   There are three direct materials used in producing the two types of pizza. The quantities of direct materials expected to be used for each pizza are as follows:

   | **12" Pizza**     | 12" Pizza | 16" Pizza |
   | ----------------- | --------- | --------- |

6. Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) is the largest bottler of Coca-Cola® in Western Europe. The company purchases Coke® and Sprite® concentrate from The Coca-Cola Company (K0), dilutes and mixes the concentrate with carbonated water, and then fills the blended beverage into cans or plastic two-liter bottles. Assume that the estimated production for Coke and Sprite two-liter bottles at the Wakefield, UK, bottling plant is as follows for the month of May:

   | Type   | Amount                    |
   | ------ | ------------------------- |
   | Coke   | 153,000 two-liter bottles |
   | Sprite | 86,500 two-liter bottles  |

   In addition, assume that the concentrate costs \$75 per pound for both Coke and Sprite and is used at a rate of 0.15 pound per 100 liters of carbonated water in blending Coke and 0.10 pound per 100 liters of carbonated water in blending Sprite. Assume that two liters of carbonated water are used for each two-liter bottle of finished product. Assume further that two-liter bottles cost \$0.08 per bottle and carbonated water costs \$0.06 per liter.

   Prepare a direct materials purchases budget for May, assuming inventories are ignored, because there are no changes between beginning and ending inventories for concentrate, bottles, and carbonated water.

### Flexible Budgeting

7. At the beginning of the period, the Fabricating Department budgeted direct labor of \$72,000 and equipment depreciation of \$18,500 for 2,400 hours of production. The department actually completed 2,350 hours of production.

   Determine the budget for the department, assuming that it uses flexible budgeting.

   - $(2350*\frac{72000}{2400})+18500=89000$

Projected sales for the next three months are as follows:

   | Month    | Value   |
   | -------- | ------- |
   | October  | $58,000 |
   | November | 65,000  |

### Static Budget versus Flexible Budget

14. The production supervisor of the Machining Department for Hagerstown Company agreed to the following monthly static budget for the upcoming year:

    | **Hagerstown Company Machining Department Monthly Production Budget** |            |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
    | Wages                                                        | $2,250,000 |
    | Utilities                                                    | 72,000     |
    | Depreciation                                                 | 36,000     |
    | Total                                                        | $2,358,000 |

    The actual amount spent and the actual units produced in the first three months in the Machining Department were as follows:

    |      | Amount Spent | Units Produced |
    | ---- | ------------ | -------------- |
    | May  | $1,600,000   | 40,000         |
    | June | 1,950,000    | 48,000         |
    | July | 2,200,000    | 52,000         |

    The Machining Department supervisor has been very pleased with this performance because actual expenditures for May–July have been significantly less than the monthly static budget of $2,358,000. However, the plant manager believes that the budget should not remain fixed for every month but should “flex” or adjust to the volume of work that is produced in the Machining Department. Additional budget information for the Machining Department is as follows:

    | item                               | Value  |
    | ---------------------------------- | ------ |
    | Wages per hour                     | $25.00 |
    | Utility cost per direct labor hour | $0.80  |
    | Direct labor hours per unit        | 1.5    |
    | Planned monthly unit production    | 60,000 |

    1. Prepare a flexible budget for the actual units produced for May, June, and July in the Machining Department. Assume depreciation is a fixed cost. If required, use per unit amounts carried out to two decimal places.

   - **flexible budget**

7. Miller and Sons' static budget for 10,000 units of production includes \$50,000 for direct materials, \$44,000 for direct labor, variable utilities of \$5,000, and supervisor salaries of \$24,000. A flexible budget for 12,000 units of production would show **direct materials of \$60,000, direct labor of ​\$52,800, utilities of \$6,000, and supervisor salaries of \$24,000**.

8. At the beginning of the period, the Assembly Department budgeted direct labor of \$110,000, direct materials of ​\$170,000, and fixed factory overhead of \$28,000 for 8,000 hours of production. The department actually completed 10,000 hours of production. The appropriate total budget for the department, assuming it uses flexible budgeting, is $(10000*\frac{110000}{8000})+(10000*\frac{170000}{8000})+28000=378000$

9. Below is budgeted production and sales information for Flushing Company for the month of December.

4. Under the variable cost method, only variable costs are included in the cost amount per unit to which the markup is added.

   - **True**

5. The amount of increase or decrease in cost that is expected from a particular course of action as compared with an alternative is **differential cost**.

6. Delaney Company is considering replacing equipment that originally cost \$600,000 and has accumulated depreciation of ​\$420,000 to date. A new machine will cost \$790,000 and the old equipment can be sold for ​\$8,000. The sunk cost in this situation is $600000-420000=180000$

7. Starling Co. is considering disposing of a machine with a book value of \$12,500 and estimated remaining life of five years. The old machine can be sold for ​\$1,500. A new high-speed machine can be purchased at a cost of \$25,000. It will have a useful life of five years and no residual value. It is estimated that the annual variable manufacturing costs will be reduced from ​\$26,000 to \$23,500 if the new machine is purchased. The five-year differential effect on profit from replacing the machine is a(n) **decrease of ** $12500-23500=(11000)$

8. Mallard Corporation uses the product cost method of product pricing. Below is cost information for the production and sale of 45,000 units of its sole product. Mallard desires a profit equal to a 12% return on invested assets of $800,000.

   | Item                                              | Value   |
   | ------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
   | Fixed factory overhead cost                       | $82,000 |

   | Variable direct materials cost per unit           | 5.50    |
   | Variable direct labor cost per unit               | 7.65    |
   | Variable factory overhead cost per unit           | 2.25    |
   | Variable selling and administrative cost per unit | 0.90    |

   The unit selling price for the company's product is $21.25$

9. Widgeon Co. manufactures three products: Bales, Tales, and Wales. The selling prices are $55, $78, and \$32, respectively. The variable costs for each product are \$20, \$50, and ​\$15, respectively. Each product must go through the same processing in a machine that is limited to 2,000 hours per month. Bales take 5 hours to process; Tales 7 hours; and Wales 1 hour.

   Assuming that Widgeon Co. can sell all of the products it can make, the maximum contribution margin it can earn per month is $34000$

10. Swan Company produces its product at a total cost of \$43 per unit. Of this amount, \$8 per unit is selling and administrative costs. The total variable cost is $30 per unit, and the desired profit is \$20 per unit.

    The markup percentage on variable cost is $110\%$.

### Accept Business at Special Price

11. Product A is normally sold for \$47 per unit. A special price of ​\$31 is offered for the export market. The variable production cost is \$26 per unit. An additional export tariff of 14% of revenue must be paid for all export products. Assume there is sufficient capacity for the special order.

1. Magpie Corporation uses the total cost method of product pricing. Below is cost information for the production and sale of 60,000 units of its sole product. Magpie desires a profit equal to a 25% return on invested assets of $700,000.

   | Item                                              | Value   |
   | ------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
   | Fixed factory overhead cost                       | $38,700 |
   | Fixed selling and administrative costs            | 7,500   |
   | Variable direct materials cost per unit           | 4.60    |
   | Variable direct labor cost per unit               | 1.88    |
   | Variable factory overhead cost per unit           | 1.13    |
   | Variable selling and administrative cost per unit | 4.50    |

   The markup percentage on total cost for Magpie's product is $\frac{700000*25\%}{38700+7500+[(4.6+1.88+1.13+4.5)*60000]}=22.6\%$

2. All of the following should be considered in a make-or-buy decision **quality issues with the supplier**, **future growth in the plant and other production opportunities**, and **cost savings**.

3. The amount of increase or decrease in revenue that is expected from a particular course of action as compared with an alternative is **differential revenue**.

4. Carmen Co. can further process Product J to produce Product D. Product J is currently selling for \$20.00 per pound and costs ​\$15.75 per pound to produce. Product D would sell for \$38.00 per pound and would require an additional cost of ​\$8.55 per pound to produce.

   The differential revenue of producing Product D is $38-20=$ **$18.00 per pound​**.

5. Dotterel Corporation uses the variable cost method of product pricing. Below is cost information for the production and sale of 35,000 units of its sole product. Dotterel desires a profit equal to an 11.2% return on invested assets of $350,000.

   1. Assuming that the desired rate of return is 15%, determine the net present value for the proposal. **If required, round to the nearest dollar.** Use the table of the present value of \$1 presented above.
      - Present value of net cash flow: $(80000*.87)+(65000*.756)+(50000*.658)+(40000*.572)=174520$
      - Amount to be invested: $150000$
      - Net present value: $174520-150000=24520$
   2. Would management be likely to look with favor on the proposal?
      - **Yes** , because the net present value indicates that the return on the proposal is **greater** than the minimum desired rate of return of 15%.

### Process Activity Analysis

9. Roen Company incurred an activity cost of \$105,600 for inspecting 40,000 units of production. Management determined that the inspecting objectives could be met without inspecting every unit. Therefore, rather than inspecting 40,000 units of production, the inspection activity was limited to a random selection of 5,000 units out of the 40,000 units of production.

   Determine the inspection activity cost per unit on 40,000 units of total production both before and after the improvement. If required, round per unit amounts to the nearest cent.

   - Inspection activity before improvement: $\frac{105600}{40000}=2.64$
     Inspection activity after improvement: $\frac{5000*2.64}{40000}=.33$

3. Moses Moonrocks Inc. has developed a balanced scorecard with a measure map that suggests that the number of erroneous shipments has a direct effect on operating profit. The company estimates that every shipment error leads to a reduction of revenue by \$3,000 and increased costs of about ​\$2,000.

   | Item                 | Value    |
   | -------------------- | -------- |
   | Sales                | $230,000 |
   | Cost of goods sold   | 150,000  |
   | Depreciation expense | 30,000   |
   | Other expenses       | 20,000   |

   If the company has the above budgeted sales and costs for next month (without accounting for any possible shipping errors), determine how many shipping errors the company can afford to have and still break even.

   - Break-even shipping errors: $\frac{230000-150000-30000-20000}{3000+2000}=6$

4. Gary’s Gumbo is a locally owned restaurant in Houston, Texas, with eight locations. The owner recently developed a new recipe for the restaurant’s signature gumbo dish. The owner decided to try out the dish in four of the company’s locations. After one month, the owner had gathered the following data:

   |                                                | **Locations** | **with New** | **Gumbo** | **Recipe** |      | **Locations** | **with Old** | **Gumbo** | **Recipe** |
   | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- | ---- | ------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- |
   | Location #                                     | 1             | 2            | 3         | 4          |      | 5             | 6            | 7         | 8          |
   | Number of orders                               | 1,253         | 1,386        | 1,495     | 1,377      |      | 1,112         | 1,025        | 1,224     | 997        |
   | Number of customer complaints (about the dish) | 34            | 36           | 44        | 32         |      | 12            | 9            | 6         | 8          |

   After looking over the data, the owner happily noted that the number of orders of the signature gumbo dish at the locations where the new recipe had been used (locations 1–4) had increased in comparison to the traditional number of orders of the dish (locations 5–8). The owner then decided to implement the new recipe at the rest of the company’s locations.

   1. Identify whether the decision of introducing the new gumbo recipe in all locations is correct.
      - **The number of orders increased along with complaints so the decision of the company should be reconsidered.**
   2. Identify the cognitive bias in this situation.
      - **The owner of the company accepted the positive feedback and ignored the negative feedback.**

5. Lonnie’s Shipping Co. is considering switching to an all-electric fleet to minimize emissions. Lonnie wants to gradually implement this change over the next 10 years. The company currently has a fleet of 100 trucks, half of which are electric-powered. Upon consulting with Lonnie, you have determined that an appropriate course of action is to include this CSR activity as a strategic objective in the company’s current balanced scorecard.

   1. Under which category of performance perspective can the CSR strategic objective of the company be included?
      - **Internal process based performance perspective**
   2. Identify a performance metric for the CSR strategic objective.
      - **The number of electric-powered trucks in the fleet.**
   3. Identify an appropriate yearly performance target for the performance metric selected in part (b).
      - **5% increase is demanded in performance to reach electric fleets for remaining 50 trucks in next ten years.**

   1. Using the given balanced scorecard, identify the strategic objectives of the company.
      - **Acquire up-to-date technology**
   2. Using the given balanced scorecard, identify the statement that explains the strategic map.
      - Acquiring up-to-date technology reduces employee turnover and production malfunction. This in turn increases the level of satisfaction of the customer and profitability.
   3. Using the given balanced scorecard, identify the statement that explains the measure map.
      - **Reducing the average age of production machinery and increasing the average employee tenure can reduce the number of production malfunctions**, **Increased average employee tenure decreases the hours from ordered to delivered**, and **Reduction in hours from ordered to delivered increases the online customer survey rating and the market share**.

7. The chief executive officer (CEO) of Cobalt Inc. just read an article written by a business professor at Harvard University describing the benefits of the lean philosophy. The CEO issued the following statement after reading the article:

   This company will become a lean manufacturing company. Presently, we have too much inventory. To become lean, we need to eliminate the excess inventory. Therefore, I want all employees to begin reducing inventories until we make products “just-in-time. ” Thank you for your cooperation.

   1. Lean manufacturing is **a philosophy that focuses on reducing time, cost, poor quality and uncertainty from a process**.
   2. A CEO of a company suddenly commands that the company will become lean manufacturing company due to increased inventory. Identify the statement that suits the situation.
      - **The CEO of the company has not given any action plans and the inventories created are not because of the production excess alone. It may even due to poor quality of the product.**

8. The American textile industry has moved much of its operations offshore in the pursuit of lower labor costs. Textile imports have risen from under 5% of all textile production in the early 1960s to over 95% today. Offshore manufacturers make long runs of standard mass-market apparel items. These are then brought to the United States in container ships, requiring significant time between original order and delivery. As a result, retail customers must accurately forecast market demands for imported apparel items.

   A textile retailer wishes to match the trend in the market and bring in new products before the competitor introduces the same. Whom should he approach and identify the reason for your answer.

   - **Domestic manufacturer** because **Domestic manufacturers can be reached quickly and make small batches of orders which will be delivered within the short time** and **Offshore manufacturers are not the trend setters and the fashion may not be same to order a large quantity at a time**.

9. Rag Swag Inc. manufactures various styles of men’s casual wear. Shirts are cut and assembled by a workforce that is paid by piece rate. This means that they are paid according to the amount of work completed during a period of time. To illustrate, if the piece rate is \$0.10 per sleeve assembled, and the worker assembles 800 sleeves during the day, then the worker would be paid \$80 (800 × \$0.10) for the day’s work.

   The company is considering adopting a lean manufacturing philosophy by organizing work cells around various types of products and employing pull manufacturing. However, no change is expected in the compensation policy. On this point, the manufacturing manager stated the following:

   “Piecework compensation provides an incentive to work fast. Without it, the workers will just goof off and expect a full day’s pay. We can’t pay straight hourly wages—at least not in this industry.”

   A garment company was following piece rate system for its employees and suddenly lean manufacturing system was introduced. The company wishes to continue with the same piece rate system. Identify the statement that suits the given situation.

   - **A piece rate system is a traditional method that is not suitable for the lean manufacturing system. Because the piece rate system increases the inventory rather than efficiency.**

10. Furry Friends Inc. manufactures toy stuffed animals. The direct labor time required to cut, sew, and stuff a toy is 10 minutes per unit. The company makes two types of stuffed toys—a lion and a bear. The lion is assembled in lot sizes of 50 units per batch, while the bear is assembled in lot sizes of 8 units per batch. Since each product has direct labor time of 10 minutes per unit, management has determined that the lead time for each product is 10 minutes.

    1. Lead time includes **value-added time**, **wait time**, and **other non-value-added time**.
    2. A toy manufacturing unit produces two types of products and the labor time for the each product is 10 minutes. The batch size of product A is 50 units and batch size of product B is 8 units. The company considers the lead time of the products is equal to the labor hour’s. Is the decision correct and supports your answer by selecting the reason.
       - **No**
    3. Reason:
       - **Lead time of the product includes value-added time, idle time and other non-value-added time.**

11. Vernon Inc. has analyzed the setup time on its computer-controlled lathe. The setup requires changing the type of fixture that holds a part. The average setup time has been 140 minutes, consisting of the following steps:

    | Item                                            | Time (minutes) |

    | Clean lathe                                     | 20             |
    | Return to tool room                             | 20             |
    | Record withdrawal of new fixture from tool room | 12             |
    | Return to lathe                                 | 15             |
    | Install new fixture and turn on machine         | 5              |
    | Total setup time                                | 140            |

    1. A company plans to setup a machine to increase the productivity. The average setup time is 140 minutes. Do you think the management needs to minimize the setup time. Identify the reason that supports the answer.
       - **Yes**
    2. Reason:
       - **The setup time should be considered because long setup time leads to increased economic cost of the setup.**
    3. A company plans to setup a machine to increase the productivity. The average setup time is 140 minutes. The company wishes to control the setup time. Identify the statement that suits the given situation.
       - **Identify the wait time and non-value-added time and eliminate that with effective planning so that the setup time can be reduced.**
    4. How much time would be required for a setup, using your suggestion in (b)?
       - $15+20+5=40$

12. Jackson Fabricators Inc. machines metal parts for the automotive industry. Under the traditional manufacturing approach, the parts are machined through two processes: milling and finishing. Parts are produced in batch sizes of 40 parts. A part requires 6 minutes in milling and 8 minutes in finishing. The move time between the two operations for a complete batch is 5 minutes.

    Under the lean philosophy, the part is produced in a cell that includes both the milling and finishing operations. The operating time is unchanged; however, the batch size is reduced to 5 parts and the move time is eliminated.

    Determine the value-added, non-value-added, and total lead times, and the value-added ratio under the traditional and lean manufacturing methods. If required, round percentages to one decimal place.

    - |                                  | Traditional Philosophy | Lean Manufacturing Philosophy |
      | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
      | Value-added time                 | $6+8=14$               | $6+8=14$                      |
      | Non-value-added time             | $[14*(40-1)]+5=551$    | $[14*(5-1)]+0=56$             |
      | Total lead time                  | $14+[14*(40-1)]+5=565$ | $14+[14*(5-1)]+0=56$          |
      | Value-added ratio (as a percent) | $\frac{14}{565}=2.5\%$ | $\frac{14}{70}=20\%$          |

13. Williams Optical Inc. is considering a new lean product cell. The present manufacturing approach produces a product in four separate steps. The production batch sizes are 45 units. The process time for each step is as follows:

    | Process Step 1 | 5 minutes |
    | -------------- | --------- |
    | Process Step 2 | 8 minutes |
    | Process Step 3 | 4 minutes |
    | Process Step 4 | 3 minutes |

    The time required to move each batch between steps is 5 minutes. In addition, the time to move raw materials to Process Step 1 is also 5 minutes, and the time to move completed units from Process Step 4 to finished goods inventory is 5 minutes.

    The new lean layout will allow the company to reduce the batch sizes from 45 units to 3 units. The time required to move each batch between steps and the inventory locations will be reduced to 2 minutes. The processing time in each step will stay the same.

    Determine the value-added, non-value-added, and total lead times, and the value-added ratio under the present and proposed production approaches. *If required, round percentages to one decimal place.*

    - |                                  | Present Approach        | Proposed Approach      |
      | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
      | Value-added time                 | $5+8+4+3=20$            | $5+8+4+3=20$           |
      | Non-value-added time             | $[20*(45-1)]+25=905$    | $[20*(3-1)]+10=50$     |
      | Total lead time                  | $20+[20*(45-1)]+25=925$ | $20+[20*(3-1)]+10=70$  |
      | Value-added ratio (as a percent) | $\frac{20}{925}=2.2\%$  | $\frac{20}{70}=28.6\%$ |

14. The following is an excerpt from an article discussing supplier relationships with the Big Three North American automakers.

    “The Big Three select suppliers on the basis of lowest price and annual price reductions,” said Neil De Koker, president of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association. “They look globally for the lowest parts prices from the lowest cost countries,” De Koker said. “There is little trust and respect. Collaboration is missing.” Japanese automakers want longterm supplier relationships. They select suppliers as a person would a mate. The Big Three are quick to beat down prices with methods such as electronic auctions or rebidding work to a competitor. The Japanese are equally tough on price but are committed to maintaining supplier continuity. “They work with you to arrive at a competitive price, and they are willing to pay because they want long-term partnering,” said Carl Code, a vice president at **Ernie Green Industries**. “They [**Honda (HMC)** and **Toyota (TM)**] want suppliers to make enough money to stay in business, grow, and bring them innovation.” The Big Three’s supply chain model is not much different from the one set by Henry Ford. In 1913, he set up the system of independent supplier firms operating at arm’s length on short-term contracts. One consequence of the Big Three’s low-price-at-all-costs mentality is that suppliers are reluctant to offer them their cutting-edge technology out of fear the contract will be resourced before the research and development costs are recouped.

    Source: Robert Sherefkin and Amy Wilson, “Suppliers Prefer Japanese Business Model,*” Rubber & Plastics News*, March 17, 2003, Vol. 24, No. 11.

    1. The Japanese supply chain model is one based on **long-term** arrangements and partnership. The Japanese automobile manufacturers want their suppliers to be financially healthy because they rely on them for **innovation** . The Big Three automakers, in contrast, are only concerned about getting the best **short-term price** from their suppliers. The article seems to imply that the longer-term benefits from partnership are being ignored by the **Big Three supply chain model** . As a result, they are willing to view their supplier relationships as temporary-until the next best price comes along.
    2. These suppliers support the Japanese system because it provides for win–win opportunities, whereby the customer and the supplier can both be successful. The suppliers are concerned about their margins being squeezed down to the point that they will be unable to maintain financial viability and/or provide the level of supplier service that will be demanded in the long term under the conventional **Big Three supplier model** . Suppliers are also concerned about the uncertainty of temporary or short-term contracts. Such demand volatility can add risk and cost to the **Big Three’s** business over time.
    3. Supply chain management is **often beneficial** to the customer. However, the customer may have to trade off between short-term and longer-term benefits. For example, supply chain management provides the supplier the financial incentives to invest in process and product innovation, invest in supply chain collaboration (such as EDI, RFID, and Internet collaboration), and share best practices, such as lean manufacturing principles, across business entities. Such investments provide the customer access to new technologies, new ideas, more efficient processes, and ultimately lower costs and higher value for all parties involved in the supply chain.

15. *Quickie Designs Inc.* uses teams in the manufacture of lightweight wheelchairs. Two features of its team approach are team hiring and peer reviews. Under team hiring, the team recruits, interviews, and hires new team members from within the organization. Using peer reviews, the team evaluates each member of the team with regard to quality, knowledge, teamwork, goal performance, attendance, and safety. These reviews provide feedback to the team member for improvement.

    Using these two team approaches rather than managers to hire and evaluate employees have all the following advantages *except:*

    - **Employee empowerment and job satisfaction will likely decrease with a team approach because it is more time consuming.**

16. The management of Daddy-O’s fast-food franchise wants to provide hamburgers quickly to customers. It has been using a process by which precooked hamburgers are prepared and placed under hot lamps. These hamburgers are then sold to customers. In this process, every customer receives the same type of hamburger and dressing (ketchup, onions, mustard). If a customer wants something different, then a “special order” must be cooked to the customer’s requirements. This requires the customer to wait several minutes, which often slows down the service line. Daddy-O’s has been receiving more and more special orders from customers, which has been slowing service down considerably.

    1. The present Daddy-O’s service delivery system is an example of a **push** system. Under this system, the customer wait time would be **short** only if the customer ordered a "standard" burger from the inventory.
    2. Daddy-O’s should introduce a new system designed so that a custom order is introduced **after** cooking. In this way, hamburgers are made to order without the use of **finished goods** inventory.

17. Eon Technologies has recently implemented a lean manufacturing approach. A production manager has approached the controller with the following comments:

    I am very upset with our accounting system now that we have implemented our new lean manufacturing methods. It seems as if all I’m doing is paperwork. Our product is moving so fast through the manufacturing process that the paperwork can hardly keep up. For example, it just doesn’t make sense to me to fill out daily labor reports. The employees are assigned to complete cells, performing many different tasks. I can’t keep up with direct labor reports on each individual task. I thought we were trying to eliminate waste. Yet the information requirements of the accounting system are slowing us down and adding to overall lead time. Moreover, I’m still getting my monthly variance reports. I don’t think that these are necessary. I have nonfinancial performance measures that are more timely than these reports. Besides, the employees don’t really understand accounting variances. How about giving some information that I can really use?

    As noted by the department manager, the accounting system for a lean system should consider all the following unique characteristics *except:*

    - **There are more transactions to record under the lean system.**

18. Bright Night, Inc., manufactures light bulbs. Its purchasing policy requires that the purchasing agents place each quarter’s purchasing requirements out for bid. This is because the Purchasing Department is evaluated solely by its ability to get the lowest purchase prices. The lowest bidder receives the order for the next quarter (90 working days).

    To make its bulb products, Bright Night requires 36,000 pounds of glass per quarter. Bright Night received two glass bids for the third quarter, as follows:

    *Central Glass Company:* $30.00 per pound of glass. Delivery schedule: 36,000 (400 lbs. × 90 days) pounds at the beginning of July to last for 3 months.

    *Ithaca Glass Company:* $30.20 per pound of glass. Delivery schedule: 400 pounds per working day (90 days in the quarter).

    Bright Night accepted Central Glass Company’s bid because it was the low-cost bid.

    *Required:*

    1. A manufacturing company gets quotes from each supplier and allocates the purchase order to the company which quotes the lowest price with the expected quality. Is this process effective in long run? Identify reason that supports the answer.

       - **No**

    2. A manufacturing company gets quotes from each supplier and allocates the purchase order to the company which quotes the lowest price with the expected quality. Are there any additional costs that are involved in bulk purchase for the quarter? Identify reason that supports the answer.

       - **No**

       Reason:

       - **The cost of storage, obsolescence, material management and wastages are ignored in this concept.**

    3. Considering only inventory financing costs, what is the additional cost per pound of Central Glass Company’s bid if the annual cost of money is 8%? (*Hint:* Determine the average value of glass inventory held for the quarter and multiply by the quarterly interest charge, then divide by the number of pounds.) *Round to the nearest cent.*

       - $\frac{\frac{36000}{2}*30*2\%}{36000}=.3$

## Homework Exercises

1. Moses Moonrocks Inc. has developed a balanced scorecard with a measure map that suggests that the number of erroneous shipments has a direct effect on operating profit. The company estimates that every shipment error leads to a reduction of revenue by \$7,050 and increased costs of about ​\$4,700.

   | Item                 | Value    |
   | -------------------- | -------- |
   | Sales                | $231,000 |
   | Cost of goods sold   | 149,000  |
   | Depreciation expense | 17,000   |
   | Other expenses       | 18,000   |

   If the company has the above budgeted sales and costs for next month (without accounting for any possible shipping errors), determine how many shipping errors the company can afford to have and still break even.

   - Break-even shipping errors: $\frac{231000-149000-17000-18000}{7050+4700}=4$

2. Henry’s Cafe is a local restaurant that is growing quickly. While the company does not yet have a balanced scorecard, Henry has mentioned that being efficient in producing meals is a high priority of his business and appears to be a significant driver of profits. Henry tells you he gathers the following data: sales, cost of labor, employee turnover, labor hours, cost of ingredients, overhead costs, average training hours per employee, number of erroneous meals prepared, the time when orders were made (e.g., at 12:43 pm), the time when orders were delivered, and number of customers per day.

   1. Under which performance perspective on the balanced scorecard should Henry’s strategic objective to efficiently produce meals be placed?

      - **Internal processes**

   2. Identify the performance metrics that the owner should concentrate on to measure the strategic objective of producing efficient meals.

      - **minutes from ordered to delivered**, **labor hours per meal**, **number of erroneous meals prepared per hour**, and **cost of ingredients per meal and the number of meals per hour**.

   3. Identify whether the performance metrics you suggested in part (b) are leading or lagging indicators relative to a performance metric “total cost of production per meal.”

      - | Performance Metric                          | Type of Indicator |
        | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
        | Minutes from ordered to delivered           | **Leading**       |
        | Labor hours per meal                        | **Leading**       |
        | Number of erroneous meals prepared per hour | **Leading**       |
        | Cost of ingredients per meal                | **Leading**       |
        | Number of meals produced per hour           | **Leading**       |

3. Gary’s Gumbo is a locally owned restaurant in Houston, Texas, with eight locations. The owner recently developed a new recipe for the restaurant’s signature gumbo dish. The owner decided to try out the dish in four of the company’s locations. After one month, the owner had gathered the following data:

   |                                                | **Locations** | **with New** | **Gumbo** | **Recipe** |      | **Locations** | **with Old** | **Gumbo** | **Recipe** |
   | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- | ---- | ------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- |
   | Location #                                     | 1             | 2            | 3         | 4          |      | 5             | 6            | 7         | 8          |
   | Number of orders                               | 1,253         | 1,386        | 1,495     | 1,377      |      | 1,112         | 1,025        | 1,224     | 997        |
   | Number of customer complaints (about the dish) | 34            | 36           | 44        | 32         |      | 12            | 9            | 6         | 8          |

   After looking over the data, the owner happily noted that the number of orders of the signature gumbo dish at the locations where the new recipe had been used (locations 1–4) had increased in comparison to the traditional number of orders of the dish (locations 5–8). The owner then decided to implement the new recipe at the rest of the company’s locations.

   1. Identify whether the decision of introducing the new gumbo recipe in all locations is correct.
      - **The number of orders increased along with complaints so the decision of the company should be reconsidered.**
   2. Identify the cognitive bias in this situation.
      - The owner of the company accepted the positive feedback and ignored the negative feedback.

4. Lonnie’s Shipping Co. is considering switching to an all-electric fleet to minimize emissions. Lonnie wants to gradually implement this change over the next 10 years. The company currently has a fleet of 100 trucks, half of which are electric-powered. Upon consulting with Lonnie, you have determined that an appropriate course of action is to include this CSR activity as a strategic objective in the company’s current balanced scorecard.

8. Coulson and Company is a large retail business that has a firm-wide balanced scorecard. Recently, management has discussed the need for the balanced scorecard to be more relevant to each individual department of the company. Specifically, management wants to come up with unique scorecards for its Public Relations and Inventory Management departments. For both departments, management recognizes that properly and efficiently training employees is important. For these purposes, management gathers data on the median training hours per employee and new employee performance review ratings. For the Inventory Management Department, management is focused on reducing stockouts (running out of certain inventory items) and keeping accurate inventory counts. For these purposes, the company tracks the number of back orders and discrepancies between the physical and record counts of inventory, respectively. For the Public Relations Department, management is focused on improving the public’s CSR image of the company and attracting new customers. Management measures these objectives using Forbes CSR Rating of Coulson and Company and the number of new customers, respectively.

   1. Identify a name that suits the scorecard of the public relation and inventory management departments.

      - **Cascading scorecard**

   2. Identify the common metrics for both the departments in the new unique scorecards.

      - **Employee training hours and employee performance**

      Identify the unique metrics of inventory management department.

9. Silver Lining Inc. has a balanced scorecard with a strategy map that shows that delivery time and the number of erroneous shipments are expected to affect the company’s ability to satisfy the customer. Further, the strategy map for the balanced scorecard shows that the hours from ordered to delivered affects the percentage of customers who shop again, and the number of erroneous shipments affects the online customer satisfaction rating. The following information is also available:

   ​  The company’s target hours from ordered to delivered is 20.

   ​  Every hour over the ordered-to-delivered target results in a 0.5% decrease in the percentage of customers who shop again.

   ​  The company’s target number of erroneous shipments per year is no more than 65.

   ​  Every error over the erroneous shipments target results in a 0.05 point decrease in the online customer satisfaction rating and an added future financial loss of $600.

   ​  The company estimates that for every 1% decrease in the percentage of customers who shop again, future profit decreases by $5,000 and market share decreases by 0.3%.

   ​  The company also estimates that for every 1 point decrease in the overall online customer satisfaction rating (on a scale of 1 to 10), future profit decreases by $4,000 and market share decreases by 0.6%.

   Using these estimates, determine how much future profit and future market share will change if:

   ​  Average hours from ordered to shipped is 27.5.

   ​  Average shipping time (hours from shipped to delivered) is 14.3.

   ​  Number of erroneous shipments is 90.

   - Total decrease in future profit: $[([(27.5+14.3)-20]*.1\%)*5000]+([90-65]*600)+[(90-65)*.05*4000]=25450$
     Total decrease in future market share: $([(27.5+14.3)-20]*.1\%*.3\%)+[(90-65)*.05*.6\%]=1.08\%$

28. Silver Lining Inc. has a balanced scorecard with a strategy map that shows that delivery time and the number of erroneous shipments are expected to affect the company’s ability to satisfy the customer. Further, the strategy map for the balanced scorecard shows that the hours from ordered to delivered affects the percentage of customers who shop again, and the number of erroneous shipments affects the online customer satisfaction rating. The following information is also available:

    ​ The company’s target hours from ordered to delivered is 30.

    ​ Every hour over the ordered-to-delivered target results in a 0.5% decrease in the percentage of customers who shop again.

    ​ The company’s target number of erroneous shipments per year is no more than 55.

    ​ Every error over the erroneous shipments target results in a 0.05 point decrease in the online customer satisfaction rating and an added future financial loss of $700.

### Average Rate of Return—New Product

1. Hana Inc. is considering an investment in new equipment that will be used to manufacture a smartphone. The phone is expected to generate additional annual sales of 7,200 units at \$172 per unit. The equipment has a cost of \$602,600, residual value of \$45,400, and an 8-year life. The equipment can only be used to manufacture the phone. The cost to manufacture the phone follows:

   | Cost per unit: |                                           |                     |         |
   | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------- |
   |                | Direct labor                              | $28.00              |         |
   |                | Direct materials                          | 109.00              |         |
   |                | Factory overhead (including depreciation) | 19.25               |         |
   |                |                                           | Total cost per unit | $156.25 |

   Determine the average rate of return on the equipment. If required, round to the nearest whole percent.

   - $\frac{(172*7200)-(156.25*7200)}{\frac{602600+45400}{2}}=35\%$

### Cash Payback Period for a Service Company

2. Jane’s Clothing Inc. is evaluating two capital investment proposals for a retail outlet, each requiring an investment of \$175,000 and each with an eight-year life and expected total net cash flows of \$280,000. Location 1 is expected to provide equal annual net cash flows of \$35,000, and Location 2 is expected to have the following unequal annual net cash flows:

   | Year   | Value   |
   | ------ | ------- |
   | Year 1 | $79,000 |
   | Year 2 | 60,000  |
   | Year 3 | 36,000  |
   | Year 4 | 34,000  |
   | Year 5 | 25,000  |
   | Year 6 | 19,000  |
   | Year 7 | 15,000  |
   | Year 8 | 12,000  |

   Determine the cash payback period for both location proposals.

   - Location 1: $\frac{175000}{35000}=5$
     Location 2: $3$

### Compute Lead Time

3. Jackson Fabricators Inc. machines metal parts for the automotive industry. Under the traditional manufacturing approach, the parts are machined through two processes: milling and finishing. Parts are produced in batch sizes of 65 parts. A part requires 4 minutes in milling and 7 minutes in finishing. The move time between the two operations for a complete batch is 8 minutes.

   Under the lean philosophy, the part is produced in a cell that includes both the milling and finishing operations. The operating time is unchanged; however, the batch size is reduced to 3 parts and the move time is eliminated.

   Determine the value-added, non-value-added, and total lead times, and the value-added ratio under the traditional and lean manufacturing methods. If required, round percentages to one decimal place.

   - |                                  | Traditional Philosophy | Lean Manufacturing Philosophy |
     | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
     | Value-added time                 | $4+7=11$               | $4+7=11$                      |
     | Non-value-added time             | $[11*(65-1)]+8=712$    | $[11*(3-1)]+0=22$             |
     | Total lead time                  | $11+712=723$           | $11+22=33$                    |
     | Value-added ratio (as a percent) | $\frac{11}{723}=1.5\%$ | $\frac{11}{33}=33.3$          |

### Decision on Accepting Additional Business

4. Homestead Jeans Co. has an annual plant capacity of 65,000 units, and current production is 45,000 units. Monthly fixed costs are \$54,000, and variable costs are ​\$29 per unit. The present selling price is \$42 per unit. On November 12 of the current year, the company received an offer from Dawkins Company for 18,000 units of the product at ​\$32 each. Dawkins Company will market the units in a foreign country under its own brand name. The additional business is not expected to affect the domestic selling price or quantity of sales of Homestead Jeans Co.

   1. Prepare a differential analysis dated November 12 on whether to reject (Alternative 1) or accept (Alternative 2) the Dawkins order. If an amount is zero, enter "0". If required, use a minus sign to indicate a loss.

      - | Differential Analysis<br />Reject Order (Alt. 1) or Accept Order (Alt. 2)<br />November 12 |                              |                              |                                      |

        | Costs:                                                       |                              |                              |                                      |
        | Variable manufacturing costs                                 | 0                            | $18000*29=-522000$           | -522000                              |
        | Profit (Loss)                                                | $0                           | $576000-522000=54000$        | $54000                               |

   2. Having unused capacity available is **relevant** to this decision. The differential revenue is **more** than the differential cost. Thus, accepting this additional business will result in a net **profit**.

   3. What is the minimum price per unit that would produce a positive contribution margin? *Round your answer to two decimal places.*

      - $29.01$
        Any selling price above $29 (variable costs per unit) will produce a positive contribution margin.

### Differential Analysis for a Lease or Sell Decision

5. Burlington Construction Company is considering selling excess machinery with a book value of \$281,300 (original cost of ​\$400,600 less accumulated depreciation of \$119,300) for ​\$277,100, less a 5% brokerage commission. Alternatively, the machinery can be leased for a total of \$286,800 for five years, after which it is expected to have no residual value. During the period of the lease, Burlington Construction Company's costs of repairs, insurance, and property tax expenses are expected to be ​\$26,300.

   1. Prepare a differential analysis dated January 15 to determine whether Burlington Construction Company should lease (Alternative 1) or sell (Alternative 2) the machinery. If required, use a minus sign to indicate a loss.

### Lean Accounting

6. Com-Tel Inc. manufactures and assembles two models of smartphones—the Tiger Model and the Lion Model. The process consists of a lean cell for each product. The data that follow concern only the Lion Model lean cell.

   For the year, Com-Tel Inc. budgeted these costs for the Lion Model production cell:

   | Conversion Cost Categories | Budget   |
   | -------------------------- | -------- |
   | Labor                      | $228,100 |
   | Supplies                   | 86,400   |
   | Utilities                  | 31,100   |
   | Total                      | $345000  |

   Com-Tel plans 3,600 hours of production for the Lion Model cell for the year. The materials cost is $82 per unit. Each assembly requires 18 minutes of cell assembly time. There was no May 1 inventory for either Raw and In Process Inventory or Finished Goods Inventory.

   The following summary events took place in the Lion Model cell during May:

   ​  Electronic parts were purchased to produce 12,250 Lion Model assemblies in May.

   ​  Conversion costs were applied for 11,650 units of production in May.

   ​  11,420 units were completed and transferred to finished goods in May.

   ​  11,080 units were shipped to customers at a price of $384 per unit.

   If required, round your answers to the nearest cent.

   1. Determine the budgeted cell conversion cost per hour.

      - $\frac{345600}{3600}=96.00$

   2. Determine the budgeted cell conversion cost per unit.

      - $96*\frac{18}{60}=28.80$

   3. Journalize the summary transactions (a) through (d). If an amount box does not require an entry, leave it blank.

   4. Determine the ending balance in Raw and In Process Inventory and Finished Goods Inventory.

      - Raw and In Process Inventory: $1004500+335520-1265336=74684$
        Finished Goods Inventory: $1265336-1227664=37672$

   5. Lean accounting is different from traditional accounting because it is more **simplified** and uses **minimal** control. As a result, the number of transactions are **reduced**. In many lean operations, purchased materials are charged to a **"raw and in process inventory" account**. Direct labor is **included as a conversion cost of the cell**. Often, nonfinancial performance measures, such as **lead time or quality measures** , are used to monitor performance.

### Make-or-Buy Decision for a Service Company

7. The Theater Arts Guild of Dallas (TAG-D) employs five people in its Publication Department. These people lay out pages for pamphlets, brochures, magazines, and other publications for the TAG-D productions. The pages are delivered to an outside company for printing. The company is considering an outside publication service for the layout work. The outside service is quoting a price of $13 per layout page. The budget for the Publication Department for the current year is as follows:

   | Item                  | Value    |
   | --------------------- | -------- |
   | Salaries              | $224,000 |
   | Benefits              | 36,000   |
   | Supplies              | 21,000   |
   | Office expenses       | 39,000   |
   | Office depreciation   | 28,000   |
   | Computer depreciation | 24,000   |
   | Total                 | $372,000 |

   The department expects to lay out 24,000 pages for the current year. The Publication Department office space and equipment would be used for future administrative needs, if the department's function were purchased from the outside.

   1. Prepare a differential analysis dated February 22 to determine whether TAG-D should lay out pages internally (Alternative 1) or purchase layout services from the outside (Alternative 2). If an amount is zero, enter "0".

   2. The benefit from using an outside service is shown to be **greater** than performing the layout work internally. The fixed costs (depreciation expenses) in the budget are **irrelevant** to the decision. Thus, the work should **be** purchased from the outside on a strictly financial basis.

   3. Before electing to **lay off** the five employees, the TAG-D should consider the **long-run impact** of the decision.

### Net Present Value Method, Internal Rate of Return Method, and Analysis for a Service Company

8. The management of Advanced Alternative Power Inc. is considering two capital investment projects. The estimated net cash flows from each project are as follows:

   | Year | Wind Turbines | Biofuel Equipment |
   | ---- | ------------- | ----------------- |
   | 1    | $280,000      | $590,000          |

           | Biofuel Equipment | $\frac{1870300}{1684450}=1.11$ |

   2. Determine the internal rate of return for each project by (a) computing a present value factor for an annuity of \$1 and (b) using the present value of an annuity of ​\$1 in the table above. If required, round your present value factor answers to three decimal places and internal rate of return to the nearest whole percent.

      - |                                           | Wind Turbines                 | Biofuel Equipment              |
        | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
        | Present value factor for an annuity of $1 | $\frac{724920}{280000}=2.589$ | $\frac{1684450}{590000}=2.855$ |
        | Internal rate of return                   | $20$                          | $15$                           |

   3. The net present value, present value index, and internal rate of return all indicate that the **wind turbines** is/are a better financial opportunity compared to the **biofuel equipment** , although both investments meet the minimum return criterion of 10%.

3. Com-Tel Inc. manufactures and assembles two models of smartphones—the Tiger Model and the Lion Model. The process consists of a lean cell for each product. The data that follow concern only the Lion Model lean cell.

   For the year, Com-Tel Inc. budgeted these costs for the Lion Model production cell:

   | **Conversion Cost Categories** | **Budget** |
   | ------------------------------ | ---------- |
   | Labor                          | $50,700    |
   | Supplies                       | 19,200     |
   | Utilities                      | 6,900      |
   | Total                          | $76,800    |

   Com-Tel plans 1,600 hours of production for the Lion Model cell for the year. The materials cost is $41 per unit. Each assembly requires 18 minutes of cell assembly time. There was no May 1 inventory for either Raw and In Process Inventory or Finished Goods Inventory.

   The following summary events took place in the Lion Model cell during May:

   ​  Electronic parts were purchased to produce 5,450 Lion Model assemblies in May.

   ​  Conversion costs were applied for 5,200 units of production in May.

   ​  5,100 units were completed and transferred to finished goods in May.

   ​  4,950 units were shipped to customers at a price of $192 per unit.

   If required, round your answers to the nearest cent.

   1. Determine the budgeted cell conversion cost per hour.
      - $\frac{76800}{1600}=48$
      
   2. Determine the budgeted cell conversion cost per unit.
      - $\frac{18}{60}*48=14.40$​
      
   3. Journalize the summary transactions (a) through (d). If an amount box does not require an entry, leave it blank.

   5. Lean accounting is different from traditional accounting because it is more **simplified** and uses **minimal** control. As a result, the number of transactions are **reduced** . In many lean operations, purchased materials are charged to a **"raw and in process inventory" account** . Direct labor is **included as a conversion cost of the cell** . Often, nonfinancial performance measures, such as **lead time or quality measures** , are used to monitor performance.

4. Jackson Fabricators Inc. machines metal parts for the automotive industry. Under the traditional manufacturing approach, the parts are machined through two processes: milling and finishing. Parts are produced in batch sizes of 75 parts. A part requires 4 minutes in milling and 6 minutes in finishing. The move time between the two operations for a complete batch is 7 minutes.

   Under the lean philosophy, the part is produced in a cell that includes both the milling and finishing operations. The operating time is unchanged; however, the batch size is reduced to 6 parts and the move time is eliminated.

   Determine the value-added, non-value-added, and total lead times, and the value-added ratio under the traditional and lean manufacturing methods. If required, round percentages to one decimal place.

   - |                                  | Traditional Philosophy | Lean Manufacturing Philosophy |
     | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |

     | Non-value-added time             | $[10*(75-1)]+7=747$    | $[10*(6-1)]+0=50$             |
     | Total lead time                  | $10+747=757$           | $10+50=60$                    |
     | Value-added ratio (as a percent) | $\frac{10}{757}=1.3\%$​ | $\frac{10}{60}=16.7\%$​        |

5. Burlington Construction Company is considering selling excess machinery with a book value of \$282,000 (original cost of \$​​400,600 less accumulated depreciation of \$118,600) for \$​276,400, less a 5% brokerage commission. Alternatively, the machinery can be leased for a total of \$284,500 for five years, after which it is expected to have no residual value. During the period of the lease, Burlington Construction Company's costs of repairs, insurance, and property tax expenses are expected to be \$26,200.

   1. Prepare a differential analysis dated January 15 to determine whether Burlington Construction Company should lease (Alternative 1) or sell (Alternative 2) the machinery. If required, use a minus sign to indicate a loss.

7. At the end of May, Bergan Company had completed Jobs 200 and 305. Job 200 is for 2,390 units, and Job 305 is for 2,053 units.

      The following data relate to these two jobs:

      On May 7, Bergan Company purchased on account 10,000 units of raw materials at \$8 per unit. During May, raw materials were requisitioned for production as follows: 7,500 units for Job 200 at \$8 per unit and 1,480 units for Job 305 at ​\$5 per unit.

      During May, Bergan Company accumulated 2,500 hours of direct labor costs on Job 200 and 3,000 hours on Job 305. The total direct labor was incurred at a rate of \$28 per direct labor hour for Job 200 and ​\$24 per direct labor hour for Job 305.

      Bergan Company estimates that total factory overhead costs will be \$620,000 for the year. Direct labor hours are estimated to be 80,000.

      1. Determine the balance on the *job cost sheets* for Jobs 200 and 305 at the end of May.

         - | Job     | Balance at the end of May                                    |
           | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
           | Job 200 | $8*7500=60000$<br />$28*2500=70000$<br />$7.75*2500=19375$<br />$60000+70000+19375=149375$ |
           | Job 305 | $5*1480=7400$<br />$24*3000=72000$<br />$7.75*3000=23250$<br />$7400+72000+23250=102650$ |

      2. Determine the cost per unit for Jobs 200 and 305 at the end of May. If required, round your answers to two decimal places.

         - | Job     | Cost per unit at the end of May |
           | ------- | ------------------------------- |
           | Job 200 | $\frac{149375}{2390}=\$62.50$   |
           | Job 305 | $\frac{102650}{2053}=\$50.00$   |

8. Pine Creek Company completed 200,000 units during the year at a cost of \$3,000,000. The beginning finished goods inventory was 25,000 units at ​\$310,000. Determine the cost of goods sold for 210,000 units, assuming a FIFO cost flow.

      - Beginning inventory: $\frac{\$310000}{25000}=\$12.40$
        Completed Units: $\frac{$3000000}{200000}=\$15$
        Cost of goods: $(25000*12.40)+[(210000-25000)*25]=310000+2775000=\$3085000$

9. Ginocera Inc. is a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of custom gourment kitchen knives. A new kitchen knife series called the Kitchen Ninja was released for production in early 20Y8. In January, the company spent \$600,000 to develop a late-night advertising infomercial for the new product. During 20Y8, the company spent an additional \$1,400,000 promoting the product through these infomercials, and \$800,000 in legal costs. The knives were ready for manufacture on January 1, 20Y8.

      Ginocera uses a job order cost system to accumulate costs associated with the Kitchen Ninja Knife. The unit direct materials cost for the knife is:

      | Line item                                              |       |
      | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
      | Hardened steel blanks (used for knife shaft and blade) | $4.00 |
      | Wood (for handle)                                      | 1.50  |
      | Packaging                                              | 0.50  |

      The production process is straightforward. First, the hardened steel blanks, which are purchased directly from a raw material supplier, are stamped into a single piece of metal that includes both the blade and the shaft. The stamping machine requires one hour per 250 knives.

      After the knife shafts are stamped, they are brought to an assembly area where an employee attaches the handle to the shaft and packs the knife into a decorative box. The direct labor cost is \$0.50 per unit.

      The knives are sold to stores. Each store is given promotional materials, such as posters and aisle displays. Promotional materials cost \$60 per store. In addition, shipping costs average ​\$0.20 per knife.

      Total completed production was 1,200,000 units during the year. Other information is as follows:

      | Line item                            |           |
      | ------------------------------------ | --------- |
      | Number of customers (stores)         | 60,000    |
      | Number of knives sold                | 1,120,000 |
      | Wholesale price (to store) per knife | $16       |

      Factory overhead cost is applied to jobs at the rate of \$800 per stamping machine hour after the knife blanks are stamped. There were an additional 25,000 stamped knives, handles, and cases in process and waiting to be assembled on December 31, 20Y8.
      *In your computations, if required, round interim per unit costs to two decimal places.*

10. Technology Accessories Inc. is a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of accessories for consumer electronic products. Early in 20Y3, the company began production of a leather cover for tablet computers, called the iLeather. The cover is made of stitched leather with a velvet interior and fits snugly around most tablet computers. In January, \$750,000 was spent on developing marketing and advertising materials. For the first six months of 20Y3, the company spent an additional ​\$1,400,000 promoting the iLeather. The product was ready for manufacture on January 21, 20Y3.

      Technology Accessories Inc. uses a *job order cost system* to accumulate costs for the iLeather. Direct materials unit costs for the iLeather are as follows:

    | Item      | Value             |
    | --------- | ----------------- |
    | Leather   | $10.00            |
    | Velvet    | 5.00              |
    | Packaging | <u>0.40</u>       |
    | Total     | <u>**$15.40**</u> |

      The actual production process for the iLeather is fairly straightforward. First, leather is brought to a cutting and stitching machine. The machine cuts the leather and stitches an exterior edge into the product. The machine requires one hour per 125 iLeathers.

      After the iLeather is cut and stitched, it is brought to assembly, where assembly personnel affix the velvet interior and pack the iLeather for shipping. The direct labor cost for this work is \$0.50 per unit.

      The completed packages are then sold to retail outlets through a sales force. The sales force is compensated by a 20% commission on the wholesale price for all sales.

      Total completed production was 500,000 units during the year. Other information is as follows:

    | Item                                  | Value   |

7. Poehling Medical Center has a single operating room that is used by local physicians to perform surgical procedures. The cost of using the operating room is accumulated by each patient procedure and includes the direct materials costs (drugs and medical devices), physician surgical time, and operating room overhead. On January 1 of the current year, the annual operating room overhead is estimated to be:

   | Item                          | Value               |
   | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
   | Disposable supplies           | \$179300            |
   | Depreciation expense          | 32300               |
   | Utilities                     | 18800               |
   | Nurse salaries                | 269300              |
   | Technician wages              | <u>88300</u>        |
   | Total operating room overhead | <u>**\$588000**</u> |

   The overhead costs will be assigned to procedures, based on the number of surgical room hours. Poehling Medical Center expects to use the operating room an average of eight hours per day, seven days per week. In addition, the operating room will be shut down two weeks per year for general repairs.

   1. Determine the predetermined operating room overhead rate for the year.
         - $\frac{588000}{8*7*50}=\$210$ per hour
   2. Bill Harris had a 7-hour procedure on January 22. How much operating room overhead would be charged to his procedure, using the rate determined in part (a)?

   3. During January, the operating room was used 186 hours. The actual overhead costs incurred for January were \$38,200. Determine the *overapplied operating overhead* or *underapplied operating overhead* for the period.
         - $38200-(210*186)=860$ **overapplied**

8. Technology Accessories Inc. is a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of accessories for consumer electronic products. Early in 20Y3, the company began production of a leather cover for tablet computers, called the iLeather. The cover is made of stitched leather with a velvet interior and fits snugly around most tablet computers. In January, \$779,000 was spent on developing marketing and advertising materials. For the first six months of 20Y3, the company spent an additional ​\$1,405,000 promoting the iLeather. The product was ready for manufacture on January 21, 20Y3.

   Technology Accessories Inc. uses a job order cost system to accumulate costs for the iLeather. Direct materials unit costs for the iLeather are as follows:
       
   | Item      | Value  |
   | --------- | ------ |
   | Leather   | $10.00 |
   | Velvet    | 5.00   |
   | Packaging | 0.40   |
   | Total     | $15.40 |
   
   The actual production process for the iLeather is fairly straightforward. First, leather is brought to a cutting and stitching machine. The machine cuts the leather and stitches an exterior edge into the product. The machine requires one hour per 130 iLeathers.
   
   After the iLeather is cut and stitched, it is brought to assembly, where assembly personnel affix the velvet interior and pack the iLeather for shipping. The direct labor cost for this work is \$0.50 per unit.
   
   The completed packages are then sold to retail outlets through a sales force. The sales force is compensated by a 20% commission on the wholesale price for all sales.
   Total completed production was 540,000 units during the year. Other information is as follows:
       
   
   | Item                                  | Value   |
   | ------------------------------------- | ------- |
   | Number of iLeather units sold in 20Y3 | 500,000 |
   | Wholesale price per unit              | $40     |
   
   Factory overhead cost is applied to jobs at the rate of \$1,300 per machine hour. There were an additional 21,000 cut and stitched iLeathers waiting to be assembled on December 31, 20Y3.
   *In your computations, if required, round interim per unit costs to two decimal places and final answers to the nearest whole dollar.*

8. Kraus Steel Company has two departments, Casting and Rolling. In the Rolling Department, ingots from the Casting Department are rolled into steel sheet. The Rolling Department received 4,000 tons from the Casting Department in October. During October, the Rolling Department completed 3,900 tons, including 200 tons of work in process on October 1. The ending work in process inventory on October 31 was 300 tons.

   How many tons were started and completed during October?

   - $3900-200=3700$

9. The Rolling Department of Kraus Steel Company had 200 tons in beginning work in process inventory (60% complete) on October 1. During October, 3,900 tons were completed. The ending work in process inventory on October 31 was 300 tons (25% complete).

   What are the total equivalent units for direct materials for October if materials are added at the beginning of the process?

   - $(3900-200)+(300*100\%)=4000$

10. The Rolling Department of Kraus Steel Company had 200 tons in beginning work in process inventory (60% complete) on October 1. During October, 3,900 tons were completed. The ending work in process inventory on October 31 was 300 tons (25% complete).

    What are the total equivalent units for conversion costs?

    - $3900-(.6*200)+(.25*300)=3855$

11. The cost of direct materials transferred into the Rolling Department of Kraus Company is \$3,000,000. The conversion cost for the period in the Rolling Department is ​\$462,600. The total equivalent units for direct materials and conversion are 4,000 tons and 3,855 tons, respectively.

    Determine the direct materials and conversion costs per equivalent unit.

    - Direct materials cost per equivalent unit: $\frac{3000000}{4000}=750$
      Conversion cost per equivalent unit: $\frac{462600}{3855}=120$

12. The *costs per equivalent unit* of direct materials and conversion in the Rolling Department of Kraus Steel Company are \$750 and ​\$120, respectively. The equivalent units to be assigned costs are as follows:

    | Equivalent Units –>                    | Direct Materials | Conversion      |
    | -------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
    | Inventory in process, October 1        | 0                | 80              |
    | Started and completed during October   | <u>3700</u>      | <u>3700</u>     |
    | Transferred out of Rolling (Completed) | 3700             | 3780            |
    | Inventory in process, October 31       | <u>300</u>       | <u>75</u>       |
    | Total units to be assigned costs       | <u>**4000**</u>  | <u>**3855**</u> |

    The beginning work in process inventory on October 1 had a cost of $163,800. Determine the cost of completed and transferred-out production, the ending work in process inventory, and the total costs assigned by the Rolling Department.

    - Completed and transferred-out production: $(750*3700)+(120*3780)+163800=3392400$
      Inventory in process, October 31: $(750*300)+(120*75)=234000$
      Total costs assigned by the Rolling Department: $(750*4000)+(120*3855)+163800=3626400$

13. The costs of materials consumed in producing good units in the Forming Department of Thomas Company were \$76,000 and ​\$77,350 for September and October, respectively. The number of equivalent units produced in September and October was 800 tons and 850 tons, respectively. Evaluate the change in the cost of materials between the two months.

    - Material cost per ton, September: $\frac{76000}{800}=95$
      Material cost per ton, October: $\frac{77350}{850}=91$
      The cost of materials **decreased** by $95-91=4$ per ton between September and October

8. Radford Inc. manufactures a sugar product by a continuous process, involving three production departments—Refining, Sifting, and Packing. Assume that records indicate that direct materials, direct labor, and applied factory overhead for the first department, Refining, were \$641,900, \$224,700, and \$147,600, respectively. Also, work in process in the Refining Department at the beginning of the period totaled ​\$35,900, and work in process at the end of the period totaled \$44,300.

9. Technology Accessories Inc. is a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of accessories for consumer electronic products. Early in 20Y3, the company began production of a leather cover for tablet computers, called the iLeather. The cover is made of stitched leather with a velvet interior and fits snugly around most tablet computers. In January, \$775,000 was spent on developing marketing and advertising materials. For the first six months of 20Y3, the company spent an additional ​\$1,402,000 promoting the iLeather. The product was ready for manufacture on January 21, 20Y3.

   Technology Accessories Inc. uses a job order cost system to accumulate costs for the iLeather. Direct materials unit costs for the iLeather are as follows:

   | Item      | Value           |
   | --------- | --------------- |
   | Leather   | 10              |
   | Velvet    | 5               |
   | Packaging | <u>.4</u>       |
   | Total     | <u>**15.4**</u> |

   The actual production process for the iLeather is fairly straightforward. First, leather is brought to a cutting and stitching machine. The machine cuts the leather and stitches an exterior edge into the product. The machine requires one hour per 130 iLeathers.

   After the iLeather is cut and stitched, it is brought to assembly, where assembly personnel affix the velvet interior and pack the iLeather for shipping. The direct labor cost for this work is \$0.50 per unit.

   The completed packages are then sold to retail outlets through a sales force. The sales force is compensated by a 20% commission on the wholesale price for all sales.

   Total completed production was 500,000 units during the year. Other information is as follows:

   | Item                                  | Value  |
   | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
   | Number of ILeather units sold in 20Y3 | 460000 |
   | Wholesale price per unit              | 40     |

   Factory overhead cost is applied to jobs at the rate of \$1,300 per machine hour. There were an additional 22,000 cut and stitched iLeathers waiting to be assembled on December 31, 20Y3.

   *In your computations, if required, round interim per unit costs to two decimal places and final answers to the nearest whole dollar.*

   1. Prepare an annual income statement for the iLeather product.

   2. Determine the balances in the finished goods and work in process inventories for the iLeather product on December 31, 20Y3.

      - | Type            | Value                        |
        | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
        | Finished goods  | $40000*\$25.90=\$1036000$    |
        | Work in process | $22000*(15.4+\$10)=\$558800$ |

14. Managerial accountants could prepare all of the following reports *except* a(n) **annual report for external regulators such as the SEC**.

15. Department B had 3,000 units in Work in Process that were 25% completed at the beginning of the period at a cost of \$12,500, 13,700 units of direct materials were added during the period at a cost of \$28,700, 15,000 units were completed during the period, and 1,700 units were 95% completed at the end of the period. All materials are added at the beginning of the process. Direct labor was \$32,450 and factory overhead was ​\$18,710.

    The number of equivalent units of production for the period for conversion, if the first-in, first-out method is used to cost inventories, was $(3000*75\%)+(12000*100\%)+(1700*95\%)=15865$

16. Exotic Engine Shop uses a *job order cost system* to determine the cost of performing engine repair work. Estimated costs and expenses for the coming period are as follows:

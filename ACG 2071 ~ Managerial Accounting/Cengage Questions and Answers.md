7. At the end of May, Bergan Company had completed Jobs 200 and 305. Job 200 is for 2,390 units, and Job 305 is for 2,053 units.

      The following data relate to these two jobs:

      On May 7, Bergan Company purchased on account 10,000 units of raw materials at \$8 per unit. During May, raw materials were requisitioned for production as follows: 7,500 units for Job 200 at \$8 per unit and 1,480 units for Job 305 at ​\$5 per unit.

      During May, Bergan Company accumulated 2,500 hours of direct labor costs on Job 200 and 3,000 hours on Job 305. The total direct labor was incurred at a rate of \$28 per direct labor hour for Job 200 and ​\$24 per direct labor hour for Job 305.

      Bergan Company estimates that total factory overhead costs will be \$620,000 for the year. Direct labor hours are estimated to be 80,000.

      1. Determine the balance on the *job cost sheets* for Jobs 200 and 305 at the end of May.

         - | Job     | Balance at the end of May                                    |
           | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
           | Job 200 | $8*7500=60000$<br />$28*2500=70000$<br />$7.75*2500=19375$<br />$60000+70000+19375=149375$ |
           | Job 305 | $5*1480=7400$<br />$24*3000=72000$<br />$7.75*3000=23250$<br />$7400+72000+23250=102650$ |

      2. Determine the cost per unit for Jobs 200 and 305 at the end of May. If required, round your answers to two decimal places.

         - | Job     | Cost per unit at the end of May |
           | ------- | ------------------------------- |
           | Job 200 | $\frac{149375}{2390}=\$62.50$   |
           | Job 305 | $\frac{102650}{2053}=\$50.00$   |

8. Pine Creek Company completed 200,000 units during the year at a cost of \$3,000,000. The beginning finished goods inventory was 25,000 units at ​\$310,000. Determine the cost of goods sold for 210,000 units, assuming a FIFO cost flow.

      - Beginning inventory: $\frac{\$310000}{25000}=\$12.40$
        Completed Units: $\frac{$3000000}{200000}=\$15$
        Cost of goods: $(25000*12.40)+[(210000-25000)*25]=310000+2775000=\$3085000$

9. Ginocera Inc. is a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of custom gourment kitchen knives. A new kitchen knife series called the Kitchen Ninja was released for production in early 20Y8. In January, the company spent \$600,000 to develop a late-night advertising infomercial for the new product. During 20Y8, the company spent an additional \$1,400,000 promoting the product through these infomercials, and \$800,000 in legal costs. The knives were ready for manufacture on January 1, 20Y8.

      Ginocera uses a job order cost system to accumulate costs associated with the Kitchen Ninja Knife. The unit direct materials cost for the knife is:

      | Line item                                              |       |
      | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
      | Hardened steel blanks (used for knife shaft and blade) | $4.00 |
      | Wood (for handle)                                      | 1.50  |
      | Packaging                                              | 0.50  |

      The production process is straightforward. First, the hardened steel blanks, which are purchased directly from a raw material supplier, are stamped into a single piece of metal that includes both the blade and the shaft. The stamping machine requires one hour per 250 knives.

      After the knife shafts are stamped, they are brought to an assembly area where an employee attaches the handle to the shaft and packs the knife into a decorative box. The direct labor cost is \$0.50 per unit.

      The knives are sold to stores. Each store is given promotional materials, such as posters and aisle displays. Promotional materials cost \$60 per store. In addition, shipping costs average ​\$0.20 per knife.

      Total completed production was 1,200,000 units during the year. Other information is as follows:

      | Line item                            |           |
      | ------------------------------------ | --------- |
      | Number of customers (stores)         | 60,000    |
      | Number of knives sold                | 1,120,000 |
      | Wholesale price (to store) per knife | $16       |

      Factory overhead cost is applied to jobs at the rate of \$800 per stamping machine hour after the knife blanks are stamped. There were an additional 25,000 stamped knives, handles, and cases in process and waiting to be assembled on December 31, 20Y8.
      *In your computations, if required, round interim per unit costs to two decimal places.*

10. Technology Accessories Inc. is a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of accessories for consumer electronic products. Early in 20Y3, the company began production of a leather cover for tablet computers, called the iLeather. The cover is made of stitched leather with a velvet interior and fits snugly around most tablet computers. In January, \$750,000 was spent on developing marketing and advertising materials. For the first six months of 20Y3, the company spent an additional ​\$1,400,000 promoting the iLeather. The product was ready for manufacture on January 21, 20Y3.

      Technology Accessories Inc. uses a *job order cost system* to accumulate costs for the iLeather. Direct materials unit costs for the iLeather are as follows:

    | Item      | Value             |
    | --------- | ----------------- |
    | Leather   | $10.00            |
    | Velvet    | 5.00              |
    | Packaging | <u>0.40</u>       |
    | Total     | <u>**$15.40**</u> |

      The actual production process for the iLeather is fairly straightforward. First, leather is brought to a cutting and stitching machine. The machine cuts the leather and stitches an exterior edge into the product. The machine requires one hour per 125 iLeathers.

      After the iLeather is cut and stitched, it is brought to assembly, where assembly personnel affix the velvet interior and pack the iLeather for shipping. The direct labor cost for this work is \$0.50 per unit.

      The completed packages are then sold to retail outlets through a sales force. The sales force is compensated by a 20% commission on the wholesale price for all sales.

      Total completed production was 500,000 units during the year. Other information is as follows:

    | Item                                  | Value   |

7. Poehling Medical Center has a single operating room that is used by local physicians to perform surgical procedures. The cost of using the operating room is accumulated by each patient procedure and includes the direct materials costs (drugs and medical devices), physician surgical time, and operating room overhead. On January 1 of the current year, the annual operating room overhead is estimated to be:

   | Item                          | Value               |
   | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
   | Disposable supplies           | \$179300            |
   | Depreciation expense          | 32300               |
   | Utilities                     | 18800               |
   | Nurse salaries                | 269300              |
   | Technician wages              | <u>88300</u>        |
   | Total operating room overhead | <u>**\$588000**</u> |

   The overhead costs will be assigned to procedures, based on the number of surgical room hours. Poehling Medical Center expects to use the operating room an average of eight hours per day, seven days per week. In addition, the operating room will be shut down two weeks per year for general repairs.

   1. Determine the predetermined operating room overhead rate for the year.
         - $\frac{588000}{8*7*50}=\$210$ per hour
   2. Bill Harris had a 7-hour procedure on January 22. How much operating room overhead would be charged to his procedure, using the rate determined in part (a)?

   3. During January, the operating room was used 186 hours. The actual overhead costs incurred for January were \$38,200. Determine the *overapplied operating overhead* or *underapplied operating overhead* for the period.
         - $38200-(210*186)=860$ **overapplied**

8. Technology Accessories Inc. is a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of accessories for consumer electronic products. Early in 20Y3, the company began production of a leather cover for tablet computers, called the iLeather. The cover is made of stitched leather with a velvet interior and fits snugly around most tablet computers. In January, \$779,000 was spent on developing marketing and advertising materials. For the first six months of 20Y3, the company spent an additional ​\$1,405,000 promoting the iLeather. The product was ready for manufacture on January 21, 20Y3.

   Technology Accessories Inc. uses a job order cost system to accumulate costs for the iLeather. Direct materials unit costs for the iLeather are as follows:
       
   | Item      | Value  |
   | --------- | ------ |
   | Leather   | $10.00 |
   | Velvet    | 5.00   |
   | Packaging | 0.40   |
   | Total     | $15.40 |
   
   The actual production process for the iLeather is fairly straightforward. First, leather is brought to a cutting and stitching machine. The machine cuts the leather and stitches an exterior edge into the product. The machine requires one hour per 130 iLeathers.
   
   After the iLeather is cut and stitched, it is brought to assembly, where assembly personnel affix the velvet interior and pack the iLeather for shipping. The direct labor cost for this work is \$0.50 per unit.
   
   The completed packages are then sold to retail outlets through a sales force. The sales force is compensated by a 20% commission on the wholesale price for all sales.
   Total completed production was 540,000 units during the year. Other information is as follows:
       
   
   | Item                                  | Value   |
   | ------------------------------------- | ------- |
   | Number of iLeather units sold in 20Y3 | 500,000 |
   | Wholesale price per unit              | $40     |
   
   Factory overhead cost is applied to jobs at the rate of \$1,300 per machine hour. There were an additional 21,000 cut and stitched iLeathers waiting to be assembled on December 31, 20Y3.
   *In your computations, if required, round interim per unit costs to two decimal places and final answers to the nearest whole dollar.*

8. Kraus Steel Company has two departments, Casting and Rolling. In the Rolling Department, ingots from the Casting Department are rolled into steel sheet. The Rolling Department received 4,000 tons from the Casting Department in October. During October, the Rolling Department completed 3,900 tons, including 200 tons of work in process on October 1. The ending work in process inventory on October 31 was 300 tons.

   How many tons were started and completed during October?

   - $3900-200=3700$

9. The Rolling Department of Kraus Steel Company had 200 tons in beginning work in process inventory (60% complete) on October 1. During October, 3,900 tons were completed. The ending work in process inventory on October 31 was 300 tons (25% complete).

   What are the total equivalent units for direct materials for October if materials are added at the beginning of the process?

   - $(3900-200)+(300*100\%)=4000$

10. The Rolling Department of Kraus Steel Company had 200 tons in beginning work in process inventory (60% complete) on October 1. During October, 3,900 tons were completed. The ending work in process inventory on October 31 was 300 tons (25% complete).

    What are the total equivalent units for conversion costs?

    - $3900-(.6*200)+(.25*300)=3855$

11. The cost of direct materials transferred into the Rolling Department of Kraus Company is \$3,000,000. The conversion cost for the period in the Rolling Department is ​\$462,600. The total equivalent units for direct materials and conversion are 4,000 tons and 3,855 tons, respectively.

    Determine the direct materials and conversion costs per equivalent unit.

    - Direct materials cost per equivalent unit: $\frac{3000000}{4000}=750$
      Conversion cost per equivalent unit: $\frac{462600}{3855}=120$

12. The *costs per equivalent unit* of direct materials and conversion in the Rolling Department of Kraus Steel Company are \$750 and ​\$120, respectively. The equivalent units to be assigned costs are as follows:

    | Equivalent Units –>                    | Direct Materials | Conversion      |
    | -------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
    | Inventory in process, October 1        | 0                | 80              |
    | Started and completed during October   | <u>3700</u>      | <u>3700</u>     |
    | Transferred out of Rolling (Completed) | 3700             | 3780            |
    | Inventory in process, October 31       | <u>300</u>       | <u>75</u>       |
    | Total units to be assigned costs       | <u>**4000**</u>  | <u>**3855**</u> |

    The beginning work in process inventory on October 1 had a cost of $163,800. Determine the cost of completed and transferred-out production, the ending work in process inventory, and the total costs assigned by the Rolling Department.

    - Completed and transferred-out production: $(750*3700)+(120*3780)+163800=3392400$
      Inventory in process, October 31: $(750*300)+(120*75)=234000$
      Total costs assigned by the Rolling Department: $(750*4000)+(120*3855)+163800=3626400$

13. The costs of materials consumed in producing good units in the Forming Department of Thomas Company were \$76,000 and ​\$77,350 for September and October, respectively. The number of equivalent units produced in September and October was 800 tons and 850 tons, respectively. Evaluate the change in the cost of materials between the two months.

    - Material cost per ton, September: $\frac{76000}{800}=95$
      Material cost per ton, October: $\frac{77350}{850}=91$
      The cost of materials **decreased** by $95-91=4$ per ton between September and October

8. Radford Inc. manufactures a sugar product by a continuous process, involving three production departments—Refining, Sifting, and Packing. Assume that records indicate that direct materials, direct labor, and applied factory overhead for the first department, Refining, were \$641,900, \$224,700, and \$147,600, respectively. Also, work in process in the Refining Department at the beginning of the period totaled ​\$35,900, and work in process at the end of the period totaled \$44,300.

9. Technology Accessories Inc. is a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of accessories for consumer electronic products. Early in 20Y3, the company began production of a leather cover for tablet computers, called the iLeather. The cover is made of stitched leather with a velvet interior and fits snugly around most tablet computers. In January, \$775,000 was spent on developing marketing and advertising materials. For the first six months of 20Y3, the company spent an additional ​\$1,402,000 promoting the iLeather. The product was ready for manufacture on January 21, 20Y3.

   Technology Accessories Inc. uses a job order cost system to accumulate costs for the iLeather. Direct materials unit costs for the iLeather are as follows:

   | Item      | Value           |
   | --------- | --------------- |
   | Leather   | 10              |
   | Velvet    | 5               |
   | Packaging | <u>.4</u>       |
   | Total     | <u>**15.4**</u> |

   The actual production process for the iLeather is fairly straightforward. First, leather is brought to a cutting and stitching machine. The machine cuts the leather and stitches an exterior edge into the product. The machine requires one hour per 130 iLeathers.

   After the iLeather is cut and stitched, it is brought to assembly, where assembly personnel affix the velvet interior and pack the iLeather for shipping. The direct labor cost for this work is \$0.50 per unit.

   The completed packages are then sold to retail outlets through a sales force. The sales force is compensated by a 20% commission on the wholesale price for all sales.

   Total completed production was 500,000 units during the year. Other information is as follows:

   | Item                                  | Value  |
   | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
   | Number of ILeather units sold in 20Y3 | 460000 |
   | Wholesale price per unit              | 40     |

   Factory overhead cost is applied to jobs at the rate of \$1,300 per machine hour. There were an additional 22,000 cut and stitched iLeathers waiting to be assembled on December 31, 20Y3.

   *In your computations, if required, round interim per unit costs to two decimal places and final answers to the nearest whole dollar.*

   1. Prepare an annual income statement for the iLeather product.

   2. Determine the balances in the finished goods and work in process inventories for the iLeather product on December 31, 20Y3.

      - | Type            | Value                        |
        | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
        | Finished goods  | $40000*\$25.90=\$1036000$    |
        | Work in process | $22000*(15.4+\$10)=\$558800$ |

### Product Costing and Decision Analysis for a Service Company

6. Pleasant Stay Medical Inc. wishes to determine its product costs. Pleasant Stay offers a variety of medical procedures (operations) that are considered its “products.” The overhead has been separated into three major activities. The annual estimated activity costs and activity bases follow:

   | Activity                 | Budgeted Activity Cost | Activity Base          |
   | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
   | Scheduling and admitting | 432000                 | Number of patients     |
   | Housekeeping             | 4212000                | Number of patient days |
   | Nursing                  | <u>5376000</u>         | Weighted care unit     |
   | Total costs              | <u>**10020000**</u>    |                        |

   Total “patient days” are determined by multiplying the number of patients by the average length of stay in the hospital. A weighted care unit (wcu) is a measure of nursing effort used to care for patients. There were 192,000 weighted care units estimated for the year. In addition, Pleasant Stay estimated 6,000 patients and 27,000 patient days for the year. (The average patient is expected to have a a little more than a four-day stay in the hospital.)

   During a portion of the year, Pleasant Stay collected patient information for three selected procedures, as follows:

   | Activity-Base Usage –> | Procedure A      | Procedure B     | Procedure C      |
   | ---------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
   | Number of patients     | 280              | 650             | 1200             |
   | Average length of stay | 6                | 6               | 4                |
   | Patient Days           | <u>1680</u>      | <u>3250</u>     | <u>4800</u>      |
   | Weighted care units    | <u>**19200**</u> | <u>**6000**</u> | <u>**24000**</u> |

   Private insurance reimburses the hospital for these activities at a fixed daily rate of \$406 per patient day for all three procedures.

   1. Determine the activity rates

   - **False**

4. Activity-based costing can be used to allocate period costs to various products that the company sells.

   - **True**

5. Which of the following does *not* rely on managerial decisions involving accurate product costing?

   - **product constraints**

6. Ramapo Company produces two products, Blinks and Dinks. They are manufactured in two departments, Fabrication and Assembly. Data for the products and departments are listed below.

   | Product | Number of Units | Labor Hours per Unit | Machine Hours per Unit |
   | ------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
   | Blinks  | 1000            | 4                    | 5                      |
   | Dinks   | 2000            | 2                    | 8                      |

   All of the machine hours take place in the Fabrication Department, which has an estimated overhead of \$84,000. All of the labor hours take place in the Assembly Department, which has an estimated total overhead of \$72,000.

   Ramapo Company uses a single plantwide overhead rate to apply all factory overhead costs. The single plantwide rate, if it is based on machine hours instead of labor hours, is $\frac{84000+72000}{(1000*5)+(2000*8)}=7.43$

7. Blue Ridge Marketing Inc. manufactures two products, A and B. Presently, the company uses a single plantwide factory overhead rate for allocating overhead to products. However, management is considering moving to a multiple department rate system for allocating overhead. The following table presents information about estimated overhead and direct labor hours.

   |                      | Overhead | Direct Labor Hours | Product A | Product B |
   | -------------------- | -------- | ------------------ | --------- | --------- |
   | Painting department  | 248000   | 10000              | 16        | 4         |
   | Finishing department | 72000    | 10000              | 4         | 16        |

## Practice Exercises

### Break-Even Analysis

1. Media outlets such as ESPN and FOX Sports often have websites that provide in-depth coverage of news and events. Portions of these websites are restricted to members who pay a monthly subscription to gain access to exclusive news and commentary.

   These websites typically offer a free trial period to introduce viewers to the websites. Assume that during a recent fiscal year, [ESPN.com](https://www.espn.com/) spent $4,200,000 on a promotional campaign for the [ESPN.com](https://www.espn.com/) websites that offered two free months of service for new subscribers. In addition, assume the following information:

   | Number of months an average new customer stays with the service<br/>(including the two free months) | 14 months |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
   | Revenue per month per customer subscription                  | 10        |

    3. Explain the reason for the difference in the amount of operating income reported in (1) and (2).

       - The operating income reported under **absorption** costing exceeds the operating income reported under **variable** costing, due to **fixed** manufacturing costs that are deferred to a future month under **absorption** costing.

### Analyzing Income under Absorption and Variable Costing

16. Variable manufacturing costs are \$126 per unit, and fixed manufacturing costs are ​\$157,500. Sales are estimated to be 10,000 units.

    If an amount is zero, enter "0".

    1. How much would absorption costing operating income differ between a plan to produce 10,000 units and a plan to produce 15,000 units?
       - $10000*(\frac{157500}{10000}-\frac{157500}{15000})=52500$
    2. How much would variable costing operating income differ between the two production plans?
       - $0$ because there would be no difference in variable costing operating income.

### Contribution Margin by Segment

17. The following information is for LaPlanche Industries Inc.:

    |                         | East  | West  |
    | ----------------------- | ----- | ----- |
    | Sales volume (units):   |       |       |
    | Product XX              | 45000 | 38000 |
    | Product YY              | 60000 | 50000 |
    | Sales price:            |       |       |
    | Product XX              | 700   | 660   |
    | Product YY              | 728   | 720   |
    | Variable cost per unit: |       |       |
    | Product XX              | 336   | 336   |
    | Product YY              | 360   | 360   |

    1. Determine the contribution margin for the Product YY.
       - $[60000*(728-360)]+[50000*(720-360)]=40080000$
    2. Determine the contribution margin for the West Region.
       - $[38000*(660-336)]+[50000*(720-360)]=30312000$

### Inventory Valuation under Absorption Costing and Variable Costing

18. At the end of the first year of operations, 21,500 units remained in the finished goods inventory. The unit manufacturing costs during the year were as follows:

    | Item                      | Value |
    | ------------------------- | ----- |
    | Direct materials          | 30    |
    | Direct labor              | 18    |
    | Fixed factory overhead    | 22    |
    | Variable factory overhead | 14    |

    Determine the cost of the finished goods inventory reported on the balance sheet under (a) the absorption costing concept and (b) the variable costing concept.

    - Absorption costing: $21500*(30+18+22+14)=1806000$
      Variable costing: $21500*(30+18+14)=1333000$

### Variable and Absorption Costing–Three Products

19. Winslow Inc. manufactures and sells three types of shoes. The income statements prepared under the absorption costing method for the three shoes are as follows:

    | Product Income Statements–Absorption Costing For the Year Ended December 31, 20Y1 | Cross Training Shoes | Golf Shoes         | Running Shoes       |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
    | Revenues                                                     | 5800000              | 6900000            | 4200000             |
    | Cost of goods sold                                           | <u>(3016000)</u>     | <u>(3381000)</u>   | <u>(2814000)</u>    |
    | Gross profit                                                 | 2784000              | 3519000            | 1386000             |
    | Selling and administrative expenses                          | <u>(2436000)</u>     | <u>(2484000)</u>   | <u>(2142000)</u>    |
    | Operating Income                                             | <u>**348000**</u>    | <u>**1035000**</u> | <u>**(756000)**</u> |

    In addition, you have determined the following information with respect to allocated fixed costs:

    |                                     | Cross Training Shoes | Golf Shoes | Running Shoes |
    | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
    | Fixed costs:                        |                      |            |               |
    | Cost of goods sold                  | 928000               | 897000     | 798000        |
    | Selling and administrative expenses | 696000               | 828000     | 588000        |

    These fixed costs are used to support all three product lines and will not change with the elimination of any one product. In addition, you have determined that the effects of inventory may be ignored.

    The management of the company has deemed the profit performance of the running shoe line as unacceptable. As a result, it has decided to eliminate the running shoe line. Management does not expect to be able to increase sales in the other two lines. However, as a result of eliminating the running shoe line, management expects the profits of the company to increase by \$756,000.

    1. Are management’s decision and conclusions correct?

       - Management’s decision and conclusion are **incorrect** . The profit **will not** be improved because the fixed costs used in manufacturing and selling running shoes **will not** be avoided if the line is eliminated.

    2. Prepare a variable costing income statement for the three products. Enter a net loss as a negative number using a minus sign.

       - | Variable Costing Income Statements–Three Product Lines For the Year Ended December 31, 20Y1 | Cross Training Shoes | Golf Shoes | Running Shoes |
         | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
         | Revenues                                                     | 5800000              | 6900000    | 4200000       |
         | Variable cost of goods sold                                  | -2088000             | -2484000   | -2016000      |
         | Manufacturing margin                                         | 3712000              | 4416000    | 2184000       |
         | Variable selling and administrative expenses                 | -1740000             | -1656000   | -1554000      |
         | Contribution margin                                          | 1972000              | 2760000    | 630000        |
         | Fixed costs:                                                 |                      |            |               |
         | Fixed manufacturing costs                                    | -928000              | -897000    | -798000       |
         | Fixed selling and administrative expenses                    | -696000              | -828000    | -588000       |
         | Total fixed costs                                            | -1624000             | -1725000   | 1386000       |
         | Operating income (loss)                                      | 348000               | 1035000    | -756000       |

    3. Use the report in (b) to determine the profit impact of eliminating the running shoe line, assuming no other changes.

       - If the running shoe line were eliminated, then the contribution margin of the product line would **be eliminated** and the fixed costs **would not** be eliminated. Thus, the profit of the company would actually **decline** by **630000**. Management should keep the line and attempt to improve the profitability of the product by **increasing** prices, **increasing** volume, or **reducing** costs.

### Variable Costing

20. Marley Company has the following information for March:

    | Item                                         | Value  |
    | -------------------------------------------- | ------ |
    | Sales                                        | 912000 |
    | Variable cost of goods sold                  | 474000 |
    | Fixed manufacturing costs                    | 82000  |
    | Variable selling and administrative expenses | 238100 |
    | Fixed selling and administrative expenses    | 54700  |

    Determine the following for Marley Company for the month of March:

    1. Manufacturing margin: $912000-474000=438000$
    2. Contribution margin: $438000-238100=199900$
    3. Operating income: $199900-82000-54700=63200$

### Variable Costing–Production Exceeds Sales

21. Fixed manufacturing costs are \$44 per unit, and variable manufacturing costs are ​\$100 per unit. Production was 67,200 units, while sales were 50,400 units.
    1. Determine whether variable costing operating income is less than or greater than absorption costing operating income.
       - **Variable costing operating income is less than absorption costing.**
    2. Determine the difference in variable costing and absorption costing operating income.
       - $16800*44=739200$

### Variable Costing–Sales Exceed Production

22. The beginning inventory is 52,800 units. All of the units that were manufactured during the period and 52,800 units of the beginning inventory were sold. The beginning inventory fixed manufacturing costs are \$14.70 per unit, and variable manufacturing costs are ​\$30 per unit.
    1. Determine whether variable costing operating income is less than or greater than absorption costing operating income.
       - **Variable costing operating income is greater than absorption costing.**
    2. Determine the difference in variable costing and absorption costing operating income.
       - $52800*14.7=776160$

    3. Explain the reason for the difference in the amount of operating income reported in (1) and (2).

       - The operating income reported under **absorption** costing exceeds the operating income reported under **variable** costing, due to **fixed** manufacturing costs that are deferred to a future month under **absorption** costing.

### Analyzing Income under Absorption and Variable Costing

12. Variable manufacturing costs are \$90 per unit, and fixed manufacturing costs are ​\$69,300. Sales are estimated to be 6,300 units.

    If an amount is zero, enter "0". *Round intermediate calculations to the nearest cent and your final answers to the nearest dollar.*

    1. How much would absorption costing operating income differ between a plan to produce 6,300 units and a plan to produce 7,700 units?
       - $6300*(\frac{69300}{6300}-\frac{69300}{7700})=12600$
    2. How much would variable costing operating income differ between the two production plans?
       - $0$

### Contribution Margin by Segment

13. The following data are for Flat Bed Apparel:

    |                         | East | West |
    | ----------------------- | ---- | ---- |
    | Sales volume (units):   |      |      |
    | Product XX              | 6300 | 7100 |
    | Product YY              | 4200 | 6300 |
    | Sales price:            |      |      |
    | Product XX              | 11   | 9    |
    | Product YY              | 15   | 17   |
    | Variable cost per unit: |      |      |
    | Product XX              | 7    | 7    |
    | Product YY              | 9    | 9    |

    1. Determine the contribution margin for Product YY.
       - $[4200*(15-9)]+[6300*(17-9)]=75600$
    2. Determine the contribution margin for the West Region.
       - $[7100*(9-7)]+[6300*(17-9)]=64600$

### Inventory Valuation under Absorption Costing and Variable Costing

14. At the end of the first year of operations, 6,100 units remained in the finished goods inventory. The unit manufacturing costs during the year were as follows:

    | Item                      | Value |
    | ------------------------- | ----- |
    | Direct materials          | 29.4  |
    | Direct labor              | 16.9  |
    | Fixed factory overhead    | 6.8   |
    | Variable factory overhead | 6     |

    Determine the cost of the finished goods inventory reported on the balance sheet under (a) the absorption costing concept and (b) the variable costing concept.

    - Absorption costing: $6100*(29.4+16.9+6.8+6)=360510$
      Variable costing: $6100*(29.4+16.9+6)=319030$

### Variable and Absorption Costing—Three Products

15. Winslow Inc. manufactures and sells three types of shoes. The income statements prepared under the absorption costing method for the three shoes are as follows:

    | Product Income Statements–Absorption Costing For the Year Ended December 31, 20Y1 | Cross Training Shoes | Golf Shoes       | Running Shoes      |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
    | Revenues                                                     | 447100               | 268300           | 228100             |
    | Cost of goods sold                                           | <u>(232500)</u>      | <u>(131500)</u>  | <u>(152800)</u>    |
    | Gross profit                                                 | 214600               | 136800           | 75300              |
    | Selling and administrative expenses                          | <u>(184600)</u>      | <u>(98500)</u>   | <u>(125800)</u>    |
    | Operating Income                                             | <u>**30000**</u>     | <u>**38300**</u> | <u>**(50500)**</u> |

    In addition, you have determined the following information with respect to allocated fixed costs:

    |                                     | Cross Training Shoes | Golf Shoes | Running Shoes |
    | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
    | Fixed costs:                        |                      |            |               |
    | Cost of goods sold                  | 71500                | 34900      | 31900         |
    | Selling and administrative expenses | 53700                | 32200      | 31900         |

    These fixed costs are used to support all three product lines and will not change with the elimination of any one product. In addition, you have determined that the effects of inventory may be ignored.

    The management of the company has deemed the profit performance of the running shoe line as unacceptable. As a result, it has decided to eliminate the running shoe line. Management does not expect to be able to increase sales in the other two lines. However, as a result of eliminating the running shoe line, management expects the profits of the company to increase by \$50,500.

    1. Are management’s decision and conclusions correct?

       -  

    2. Prepare a variable costing income statement for the three products. Enter a net loss as a negative number using a minus sign.

       - | Variable Costing Income Statements–Three Product Lines For the Year Ended December 31, 20Y1 | Cross Training Shoes   | Golf Shoes            | Running Shoes          |

         | Manufacturing margin                                         | $447100-161000=286100$ | $268300-96600=171700$ | $228100-120900=107200$ |
         | Variable selling and administrative expenses                 | $184600-53700=130900$  | $98500-32200=66300$   | $125800-31900=93900$   |
         | Contribution margin                                          | $286100-130900=155200$ | $171700-66300=105400$ | $107200-93900=13300$   |
         | Fixed costs:                                                 |                        |                       |                        |
         | Fixed manufacturing costs                                    | $71500$                | 34900                 | $31900$                |
         | Fixed selling and administrative expenses                    | $53700$                | 32200                 | $31900$                |
         | Total fixed costs                                            | $71500+53700=125200$   | $34900+32200=67100$   | $31900+31900=63800$    |
         | Operating income (loss)                                      | $155200-125200=30000$  | $105400-67100=38300$  | $13300-63800=-50500$   |

    3. Use the report in (b) to determine the profit impact of eliminating the running shoe line, assuming no other changes.

       - If the running shoes line were eliminated, then the contribution margin of the product line would **be eliminated** and the fixed costs **would not** be eliminated. Thus, the profit of the company would actually **decline** by $13300$. Management should keep the line and attempt to improve the profitability of the product by **increasing** prices, **increasing** volume, or **reducing** costs.

### Variable Costing

16. Marsich Company has the following information for July:

    | Item                                         | Value  |
    | -------------------------------------------- | ------ |
    | Sales                                        | 710000 |
    | Variable cost of goods sold                  | 326600 |
    | Fixed manufacturing costs                    | 106500 |
    | Variable selling and administrative expenses | 78100  |
    | Fixed selling and administrative expenses    | 49700  |

    Determine the following for Marsich Company for the month of July:

    1. Manufacturing margin: $710000-326600=383400$
    2. Contribution margin: $383400-78100=305300$
    3. Operating income: $305300-106500-49700=149100$

### Variable Costing–Production Exceeds Sales

17. Fixed manufacturing costs are \$55 per unit, and variable manufacturing costs are ​\$165 per unit. Production was 132,000 units, while sales were 124,080 units.
    1. Determine whether variable costing operating income is less than or greater than absorption costing operating income.
       -  **Variable costing operating income is less than absorption costing.**
    2. Determine the difference in variable costing and absorption costing operating income.
       - $(132000-124080)*55=435600$

### Variable Costing–Sales Exceed Production

18. The beginning inventory is 13,300 units. All of the units that were manufactured during the period and 13,300 units of the beginning inventory were sold. The beginning inventory fixed manufacturing costs are \$47 per unit, and variable manufacturing costs are ​\$96 per unit.
    1. Determine whether variable costing operating income is less than or greater than absorption costing operating income.
       - **Variable costing operating income is greater than absorption costing.**
    2. Determine the difference in variable costing and absorption costing operating income.
       - $13300*47=625100$

# Chapter 25

## Pre-Lecture Videos

1. Which of the following steps is considered the first step in the managerial decision-making process?
   - **Identify the objective of the decision**
2. An analysis that evaluates differential revenues and costs in order to determine the differential impact on income of two alternative courses of action is called **incremental** analysis.
3. **Sunk** costs are costs that have been incurred in the past, cannot be recouped, and are not relevant to future decisions.
4. The revenue that is forgone from an alternative use of an asset, such as cash, is called **an opportunity cost.**
5. All of the following are cost-plus methods to determine selling price *except* **fixed cost concept**.
6. Which of the following determine normal selling price?
   - **Cost amount per unit plus markup**
7. Target cost is computed by **expected selling price minus desired profit**.
8. A point in the manufacturing process where the demand for the company's product exceeds the ability to produce the product is known as **production bottleneck**.
9. In a production bottleneck operation, the best measure of profitability is the **unit contribution margin per production bottleneck constraint**.
10. The last step when applying the total cost concept would be to **determine the normal selling price by adding the markup per unit to the cost per unit.**
11. Under the **variable cost concept**, only costs that change are included in the cost amount per unit to which the markup is added.

## Mini Quiz

1. **The theory of constraints** is a manufacturing strategy that focuses on reducing the influence of bottlenecks on the production process.

   2. Based on the results disclosed by the differential analysis, should the proposal be accepted?

      - **Yes**

   3.  If the proposal is accepted, what would be the total estimated operating income of the store for the 15 years?

      - $5400000-(3000000+950000)=1450000$

## Homework Exercises

1. Hill Co. can further process Product O to produce Product P. Product O is currently selling for \$60 per pound and costs ​\$42 per pound to produce. Product P would sell for \$82 per pound and would require an additional cost of ​\$13 per pound to produce.

   The differential revenue of producing Product P is \$22 per pound.

   - $82-60=22$ –> **True**

2. Make-or-buy options often arise when a manufacturer has excess productive capacity in the form of unused equipment, space, and labor.

   - **True**

3. When a bottleneck occurs in a process used in the production of multiple products, the company must determine the contribution margin for each product and give priority to the product that has the lowest contribution margin per bottleneck hour.

   - **False**

4. Under the variable cost method, only variable costs are included in the cost amount per unit to which the markup is added.

   - **True**

5. The amount of increase or decrease in cost that is expected from a particular course of action as compared with an alternative is **differential cost**.

6. Delaney Company is considering replacing equipment that originally cost \$600,000 and has accumulated depreciation of ​\$420,000 to date. A new machine will cost \$790,000 and the old equipment can be sold for ​\$8,000. The sunk cost in this situation is $600000-420000=180000$

7. Starling Co. is considering disposing of a machine with a book value of \$12,500 and estimated remaining life of five years. The old machine can be sold for ​\$1,500. A new high-speed machine can be purchased at a cost of \$25,000. It will have a useful life of five years and no residual value. It is estimated that the annual variable manufacturing costs will be reduced from ​\$26,000 to \$23,500 if the new machine is purchased. The five-year differential effect on profit from replacing the machine is a(n) **decrease of ** $12500-23500=(11000)$

8. Mallard Corporation uses the product cost method of product pricing. Below is cost information for the production and sale of 45,000 units of its sole product. Mallard desires a profit equal to a 12% return on invested assets of $800,000.

   | Item                                              | Value   |
   | ------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
   | Fixed factory overhead cost                       | $82,000 |
   | Fixed selling and administrative costs            | 45,000  |
   | Variable direct materials cost per unit           | 5.50    |
   | Variable direct labor cost per unit               | 7.65    |
   | Variable factory overhead cost per unit           | 2.25    |
   | Variable selling and administrative cost per unit | 0.90    |

   The unit selling price for the company's product is $21.25$

9. Widgeon Co. manufactures three products: Bales, Tales, and Wales. The selling prices are $55, $78, and \$32, respectively. The variable costs for each product are \$20, \$50, and ​\$15, respectively. Each product must go through the same processing in a machine that is limited to 2,000 hours per month. Bales take 5 hours to process; Tales 7 hours; and Wales 1 hour.

   Assuming that Widgeon Co. can sell all of the products it can make, the maximum contribution margin it can earn per month is $34000$

10. Swan Company produces its product at a total cost of \$43 per unit. Of this amount, \$8 per unit is selling and administrative costs. The total variable cost is $30 per unit, and the desired profit is \$20 per unit.

    The markup percentage on variable cost is $110\%$.

### Accept Business at Special Price

11. Product A is normally sold for \$47 per unit. A special price of ​\$31 is offered for the export market. The variable production cost is \$26 per unit. An additional export tariff of 14% of revenue must be paid for all export products. Assume there is sufficient capacity for the special order.

1. Magpie Corporation uses the total cost method of product pricing. Below is cost information for the production and sale of 60,000 units of its sole product. Magpie desires a profit equal to a 25% return on invested assets of $700,000.

   | Item                                              | Value   |
   | ------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
   | Fixed factory overhead cost                       | $38,700 |
   | Fixed selling and administrative costs            | 7,500   |
   | Variable direct materials cost per unit           | 4.60    |
   | Variable direct labor cost per unit               | 1.88    |
   | Variable factory overhead cost per unit           | 1.13    |
   | Variable selling and administrative cost per unit | 4.50    |

   The markup percentage on total cost for Magpie's product is $\frac{700000*25\%}{38700+7500+[(4.6+1.88+1.13+4.5)*60000]}=22.6\%$

2. All of the following should be considered in a make-or-buy decision **quality issues with the supplier**, **future growth in the plant and other production opportunities**, and **cost savings**.

3. The amount of increase or decrease in revenue that is expected from a particular course of action as compared with an alternative is **differential revenue**.

4. Carmen Co. can further process Product J to produce Product D. Product J is currently selling for \$20.00 per pound and costs ​\$15.75 per pound to produce. Product D would sell for \$38.00 per pound and would require an additional cost of ​\$8.55 per pound to produce.

   The differential revenue of producing Product D is $38-20=$ **$18.00 per pound​**.

5. Dotterel Corporation uses the variable cost method of product pricing. Below is cost information for the production and sale of 35,000 units of its sole product. Dotterel desires a profit equal to an 11.2% return on invested assets of $350,000.

   | Item                                              | Value    |
   | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
   | Fixed factory overhead cost                       | $105,000 |
   | Fixed selling and administrative costs            | 35,000   |
   | Variable direct materials cost per unit           | 4.34     |
   | Variable direct labor cost per unit               | 5.18     |
   | Variable factory overhead cost per unit           | 0.98     |
   | Variable selling and administrative cost per unit | 0.70     |

   The dollar amount of desired profit from the production and sale of Dotterel's product is $350000*11.2\%=39200$

   1. Assuming that the desired rate of return is 15%, determine the net present value for the proposal. **If required, round to the nearest dollar.** Use the table of the present value of \$1 presented above.
      - Present value of net cash flow: $(80000*.87)+(65000*.756)+(50000*.658)+(40000*.572)=174520$
      - Amount to be invested: $150000$
      - Net present value: $174520-150000=24520$
   2. Would management be likely to look with favor on the proposal?
      - **Yes** , because the net present value indicates that the return on the proposal is **greater** than the minimum desired rate of return of 15%.

    1. Assuming that the desired rate of return is 6%, determine the net present value for the proposal. Use the table of the present value of \$1 presented above. *If required, round to the nearest dollar.* If required, use the minus sign to indicate a negative net present value.
       - Present value of net cash flow: $(75000*.943)+(58000*.89)+(44000*.84)+(29000*.792)=182273$
       - Amount to be invested: $149500$
       - Net present value: $182273-149500=32773$
    2. Would management be likely to look with favor on the proposal?
       - **Yes** , because the net present value indicates that the return on the proposal is **greater** than the minimum desired rate of return of 6%.

### Process Activity Analysis

9. Roen Company incurred an activity cost of \$105,600 for inspecting 40,000 units of production. Management determined that the inspecting objectives could be met without inspecting every unit. Therefore, rather than inspecting 40,000 units of production, the inspection activity was limited to a random selection of 5,000 units out of the 40,000 units of production.

   Determine the inspection activity cost per unit on 40,000 units of total production both before and after the improvement. If required, round per unit amounts to the nearest cent.

   - Inspection activity before improvement: $\frac{105600}{40000}=2.64$
     Inspection activity after improvement: $\frac{5000*2.64}{40000}=.33$

4. Gary’s Gumbo is a locally owned restaurant in Houston, Texas, with eight locations. The owner recently developed a new recipe for the restaurant’s signature gumbo dish. The owner decided to try out the dish in four of the company’s locations. After one month, the owner had gathered the following data:

   |                                                | **Locations** | **with New** | **Gumbo** | **Recipe** |      | **Locations** | **with Old** | **Gumbo** | **Recipe** |
   | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- | ---- | ------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- |
   | Location #                                     | 1             | 2            | 3         | 4          |      | 5             | 6            | 7         | 8          |
   | Number of orders                               | 1,253         | 1,386        | 1,495     | 1,377      |      | 1,112         | 1,025        | 1,224     | 997        |

   After looking over the data, the owner happily noted that the number of orders of the signature gumbo dish at the locations where the new recipe had been used (locations 1–4) had increased in comparison to the traditional number of orders of the dish (locations 5–8). The owner then decided to implement the new recipe at the rest of the company’s locations.

   1. Identify whether the decision of introducing the new gumbo recipe in all locations is correct.
      - **The number of orders increased along with complaints so the decision of the company should be reconsidered.**

      - **Acquire up-to-date technology**
   2. Using the given balanced scorecard, identify the statement that explains the strategic map.
      - Acquiring up-to-date technology reduces employee turnover and production malfunction. This in turn increases the level of satisfaction of the customer and profitability.
   3. Using the given balanced scorecard, identify the statement that explains the measure map.
      - **Reducing the average age of production machinery and increasing the average employee tenure can reduce the number of production malfunctions**, **Increased average employee tenure decreases the hours from ordered to delivered**, and **Reduction in hours from ordered to delivered increases the online customer survey rating and the market share**.

7. The chief executive officer (CEO) of Cobalt Inc. just read an article written by a business professor at Harvard University describing the benefits of the lean philosophy. The CEO issued the following statement after reading the article:

   This company will become a lean manufacturing company. Presently, we have too much inventory. To become lean, we need to eliminate the excess inventory. Therefore, I want all employees to begin reducing inventories until we make products “just-in-time. ” Thank you for your cooperation.

   1. Lean manufacturing is **a philosophy that focuses on reducing time, cost, poor quality and uncertainty from a process**.
   2. A CEO of a company suddenly commands that the company will become lean manufacturing company due to increased inventory. Identify the statement that suits the situation.
      - **The CEO of the company has not given any action plans and the inventories created are not because of the production excess alone. It may even due to poor quality of the product.**

8. The American textile industry has moved much of its operations offshore in the pursuit of lower labor costs. Textile imports have risen from under 5% of all textile production in the early 1960s to over 95% today. Offshore manufacturers make long runs of standard mass-market apparel items. These are then brought to the United States in container ships, requiring significant time between original order and delivery. As a result, retail customers must accurately forecast market demands for imported apparel items.

   A textile retailer wishes to match the trend in the market and bring in new products before the competitor introduces the same. Whom should he approach and identify the reason for your answer.

   - **Domestic manufacturer** because **Domestic manufacturers can be reached quickly and make small batches of orders which will be delivered within the short time** and **Offshore manufacturers are not the trend setters and the fashion may not be same to order a large quantity at a time**.

9. Rag Swag Inc. manufactures various styles of men’s casual wear. Shirts are cut and assembled by a workforce that is paid by piece rate. This means that they are paid according to the amount of work completed during a period of time. To illustrate, if the piece rate is \$0.10 per sleeve assembled, and the worker assembles 800 sleeves during the day, then the worker would be paid \$80 (800 × \$0.10) for the day’s work.

   The company is considering adopting a lean manufacturing philosophy by organizing work cells around various types of products and employing pull manufacturing. However, no change is expected in the compensation policy. On this point, the manufacturing manager stated the following:

   “Piecework compensation provides an incentive to work fast. Without it, the workers will just goof off and expect a full day’s pay. We can’t pay straight hourly wages—at least not in this industry.”

   A garment company was following piece rate system for its employees and suddenly lean manufacturing system was introduced. The company wishes to continue with the same piece rate system. Identify the statement that suits the given situation.

   - **A piece rate system is a traditional method that is not suitable for the lean manufacturing system. Because the piece rate system increases the inventory rather than efficiency.**

10. Furry Friends Inc. manufactures toy stuffed animals. The direct labor time required to cut, sew, and stuff a toy is 10 minutes per unit. The company makes two types of stuffed toys—a lion and a bear. The lion is assembled in lot sizes of 50 units per batch, while the bear is assembled in lot sizes of 8 units per batch. Since each product has direct labor time of 10 minutes per unit, management has determined that the lead time for each product is 10 minutes.

    1. Lead time includes **value-added time**, **wait time**, and **other non-value-added time**.
    2. A toy manufacturing unit produces two types of products and the labor time for the each product is 10 minutes. The batch size of product A is 50 units and batch size of product B is 8 units. The company considers the lead time of the products is equal to the labor hour’s. Is the decision correct and supports your answer by selecting the reason.
       - **No**
    3. Reason:
       - **Lead time of the product includes value-added time, idle time and other non-value-added time.**

11. Vernon Inc. has analyzed the setup time on its computer-controlled lathe. The setup requires changing the type of fixture that holds a part. The average setup time has been 140 minutes, consisting of the following steps:

    | Item                                            | Time (minutes) |
    | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
    | Turn off machine and remove fixture from lathe  | 15             |
    | Go to tool room with fixture                    | 15             |
    | Record replacement of fixture to tool room      | 18             |
    | Return to lathe                                 | 20             |
    | Clean lathe                                     | 20             |
    | Return to tool room                             | 20             |
    | Record withdrawal of new fixture from tool room | 12             |
    | Return to lathe                                 | 15             |
    | Install new fixture and turn on machine         | 5              |
    | Total setup time                                | 140            |

    1. A company plans to setup a machine to increase the productivity. The average setup time is 140 minutes. Do you think the management needs to minimize the setup time. Identify the reason that supports the answer.
       - **Yes**
    2. Reason:
       - **The setup time should be considered because long setup time leads to increased economic cost of the setup.**
    3. A company plans to setup a machine to increase the productivity. The average setup time is 140 minutes. The company wishes to control the setup time. Identify the statement that suits the given situation.
       - **Identify the wait time and non-value-added time and eliminate that with effective planning so that the setup time can be reduced.**
    4. How much time would be required for a setup, using your suggestion in (b)?
       - $15+20+5=40$

12. Jackson Fabricators Inc. machines metal parts for the automotive industry. Under the traditional manufacturing approach, the parts are machined through two processes: milling and finishing. Parts are produced in batch sizes of 40 parts. A part requires 6 minutes in milling and 8 minutes in finishing. The move time between the two operations for a complete batch is 5 minutes.

    Under the lean philosophy, the part is produced in a cell that includes both the milling and finishing operations. The operating time is unchanged; however, the batch size is reduced to 5 parts and the move time is eliminated.

    Determine the value-added, non-value-added, and total lead times, and the value-added ratio under the traditional and lean manufacturing methods. If required, round percentages to one decimal place.

    - |                                  | Traditional Philosophy | Lean Manufacturing Philosophy |
      | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
      | Value-added time                 | $6+8=14$               | $6+8=14$                      |
      | Non-value-added time             | $[14*(40-1)]+5=551$    | $[14*(5-1)]+0=56$             |
      | Total lead time                  | $14+[14*(40-1)]+5=565$ | $14+[14*(5-1)]+0=56$          |
      | Value-added ratio (as a percent) | $\frac{14}{565}=2.5\%$ | $\frac{14}{70}=20\%$          |

13. Williams Optical Inc. is considering a new lean product cell. The present manufacturing approach produces a product in four separate steps. The production batch sizes are 45 units. The process time for each step is as follows:

    | Process Step 1 | 5 minutes |
    | -------------- | --------- |
    | Process Step 2 | 8 minutes |
    | Process Step 3 | 4 minutes |
    | Process Step 4 | 3 minutes |

    The time required to move each batch between steps is 5 minutes. In addition, the time to move raw materials to Process Step 1 is also 5 minutes, and the time to move completed units from Process Step 4 to finished goods inventory is 5 minutes.

    The new lean layout will allow the company to reduce the batch sizes from 45 units to 3 units. The time required to move each batch between steps and the inventory locations will be reduced to 2 minutes. The processing time in each step will stay the same.

    Determine the value-added, non-value-added, and total lead times, and the value-added ratio under the present and proposed production approaches. *If required, round percentages to one decimal place.*

    - |                                  | Present Approach        | Proposed Approach      |
      | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
      | Value-added time                 | $5+8+4+3=20$            | $5+8+4+3=20$           |
      | Non-value-added time             | $[20*(45-1)]+25=905$    | $[20*(3-1)]+10=50$     |
      | Total lead time                  | $20+[20*(45-1)]+25=925$ | $20+[20*(3-1)]+10=70$  |
      | Value-added ratio (as a percent) | $\frac{20}{925}=2.2\%$  | $\frac{20}{70}=28.6\%$ |

14. The following is an excerpt from an article discussing supplier relationships with the Big Three North American automakers.

    “The Big Three select suppliers on the basis of lowest price and annual price reductions,” said Neil De Koker, president of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association. “They look globally for the lowest parts prices from the lowest cost countries,” De Koker said. “There is little trust and respect. Collaboration is missing.” Japanese automakers want longterm supplier relationships. They select suppliers as a person would a mate. The Big Three are quick to beat down prices with methods such as electronic auctions or rebidding work to a competitor. The Japanese are equally tough on price but are committed to maintaining supplier continuity. “They work with you to arrive at a competitive price, and they are willing to pay because they want long-term partnering,” said Carl Code, a vice president at **Ernie Green Industries**. “They [**Honda (HMC)** and **Toyota (TM)**] want suppliers to make enough money to stay in business, grow, and bring them innovation.” The Big Three’s supply chain model is not much different from the one set by Henry Ford. In 1913, he set up the system of independent supplier firms operating at arm’s length on short-term contracts. One consequence of the Big Three’s low-price-at-all-costs mentality is that suppliers are reluctant to offer them their cutting-edge technology out of fear the contract will be resourced before the research and development costs are recouped.

    Source: Robert Sherefkin and Amy Wilson, “Suppliers Prefer Japanese Business Model,*” Rubber & Plastics News*, March 17, 2003, Vol. 24, No. 11.

    1. The Japanese supply chain model is one based on **long-term** arrangements and partnership. The Japanese automobile manufacturers want their suppliers to be financially healthy because they rely on them for **innovation** . The Big Three automakers, in contrast, are only concerned about getting the best **short-term price** from their suppliers. The article seems to imply that the longer-term benefits from partnership are being ignored by the **Big Three supply chain model** . As a result, they are willing to view their supplier relationships as temporary-until the next best price comes along.
    2. These suppliers support the Japanese system because it provides for win–win opportunities, whereby the customer and the supplier can both be successful. The suppliers are concerned about their margins being squeezed down to the point that they will be unable to maintain financial viability and/or provide the level of supplier service that will be demanded in the long term under the conventional **Big Three supplier model** . Suppliers are also concerned about the uncertainty of temporary or short-term contracts. Such demand volatility can add risk and cost to the **Big Three’s** business over time.
    3. Supply chain management is **often beneficial** to the customer. However, the customer may have to trade off between short-term and longer-term benefits. For example, supply chain management provides the supplier the financial incentives to invest in process and product innovation, invest in supply chain collaboration (such as EDI, RFID, and Internet collaboration), and share best practices, such as lean manufacturing principles, across business entities. Such investments provide the customer access to new technologies, new ideas, more efficient processes, and ultimately lower costs and higher value for all parties involved in the supply chain.

15. *Quickie Designs Inc.* uses teams in the manufacture of lightweight wheelchairs. Two features of its team approach are team hiring and peer reviews. Under team hiring, the team recruits, interviews, and hires new team members from within the organization. Using peer reviews, the team evaluates each member of the team with regard to quality, knowledge, teamwork, goal performance, attendance, and safety. These reviews provide feedback to the team member for improvement.

    Using these two team approaches rather than managers to hire and evaluate employees have all the following advantages *except:*

    - **Employee empowerment and job satisfaction will likely decrease with a team approach because it is more time consuming.**

16. The management of Daddy-O’s fast-food franchise wants to provide hamburgers quickly to customers. It has been using a process by which precooked hamburgers are prepared and placed under hot lamps. These hamburgers are then sold to customers. In this process, every customer receives the same type of hamburger and dressing (ketchup, onions, mustard). If a customer wants something different, then a “special order” must be cooked to the customer’s requirements. This requires the customer to wait several minutes, which often slows down the service line. Daddy-O’s has been receiving more and more special orders from customers, which has been slowing service down considerably.

    1. The present Daddy-O’s service delivery system is an example of a **push** system. Under this system, the customer wait time would be **short** only if the customer ordered a "standard" burger from the inventory.
    2. Daddy-O’s should introduce a new system designed so that a custom order is introduced **after** cooking. In this way, hamburgers are made to order without the use of **finished goods** inventory.

17. Eon Technologies has recently implemented a lean manufacturing approach. A production manager has approached the controller with the following comments:

    I am very upset with our accounting system now that we have implemented our new lean manufacturing methods. It seems as if all I’m doing is paperwork. Our product is moving so fast through the manufacturing process that the paperwork can hardly keep up. For example, it just doesn’t make sense to me to fill out daily labor reports. The employees are assigned to complete cells, performing many different tasks. I can’t keep up with direct labor reports on each individual task. I thought we were trying to eliminate waste. Yet the information requirements of the accounting system are slowing us down and adding to overall lead time. Moreover, I’m still getting my monthly variance reports. I don’t think that these are necessary. I have nonfinancial performance measures that are more timely than these reports. Besides, the employees don’t really understand accounting variances. How about giving some information that I can really use?

    As noted by the department manager, the accounting system for a lean system should consider all the following unique characteristics *except:*

    - **There are more transactions to record under the lean system.**

18. Bright Night, Inc., manufactures light bulbs. Its purchasing policy requires that the purchasing agents place each quarter’s purchasing requirements out for bid. This is because the Purchasing Department is evaluated solely by its ability to get the lowest purchase prices. The lowest bidder receives the order for the next quarter (90 working days).

    To make its bulb products, Bright Night requires 36,000 pounds of glass per quarter. Bright Night received two glass bids for the third quarter, as follows:

    *Central Glass Company:* $30.00 per pound of glass. Delivery schedule: 36,000 (400 lbs. × 90 days) pounds at the beginning of July to last for 3 months.

    *Ithaca Glass Company:* $30.20 per pound of glass. Delivery schedule: 400 pounds per working day (90 days in the quarter).

    Bright Night accepted Central Glass Company’s bid because it was the low-cost bid.

    *Required:*

    1. A manufacturing company gets quotes from each supplier and allocates the purchase order to the company which quotes the lowest price with the expected quality. Is this process effective in long run? Identify reason that supports the answer.

       - **No**

    2. A manufacturing company gets quotes from each supplier and allocates the purchase order to the company which quotes the lowest price with the expected quality. Are there any additional costs that are involved in bulk purchase for the quarter? Identify reason that supports the answer.

       - **No**

       Reason:

       - **The cost of storage, obsolescence, material management and wastages are ignored in this concept.**

    3. Considering only inventory financing costs, what is the additional cost per pound of Central Glass Company’s bid if the annual cost of money is 8%? (*Hint:* Determine the average value of glass inventory held for the quarter and multiply by the quarterly interest charge, then divide by the number of pounds.) *Round to the nearest cent.*

       - $\frac{\frac{36000}{2}*30*2\%}{36000}=.3$

## Homework Exercises

1. Moses Moonrocks Inc. has developed a balanced scorecard with a measure map that suggests that the number of erroneous shipments has a direct effect on operating profit. The company estimates that every shipment error leads to a reduction of revenue by \$7,050 and increased costs of about ​\$4,700.

   | Item                 | Value    |
   | -------------------- | -------- |
   | Sales                | $231,000 |
   | Cost of goods sold   | 149,000  |
   | Depreciation expense | 17,000   |
   | Other expenses       | 18,000   |

   If the company has the above budgeted sales and costs for next month (without accounting for any possible shipping errors), determine how many shipping errors the company can afford to have and still break even.

   - Break-even shipping errors: $\frac{231000-149000-17000-18000}{7050+4700}=4$

2. Henry’s Cafe is a local restaurant that is growing quickly. While the company does not yet have a balanced scorecard, Henry has mentioned that being efficient in producing meals is a high priority of his business and appears to be a significant driver of profits. Henry tells you he gathers the following data: sales, cost of labor, employee turnover, labor hours, cost of ingredients, overhead costs, average training hours per employee, number of erroneous meals prepared, the time when orders were made (e.g., at 12:43 pm), the time when orders were delivered, and number of customers per day.

   1. Under which performance perspective on the balanced scorecard should Henry’s strategic objective to efficiently produce meals be placed?

      - **Internal processes**

   2. Identify the performance metrics that the owner should concentrate on to measure the strategic objective of producing efficient meals.

      - **minutes from ordered to delivered**, **labor hours per meal**, **number of erroneous meals prepared per hour**, and **cost of ingredients per meal and the number of meals per hour**.

   3. Identify whether the performance metrics you suggested in part (b) are leading or lagging indicators relative to a performance metric “total cost of production per meal.”

      - | Performance Metric                          | Type of Indicator |
        | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
        | Minutes from ordered to delivered           | **Leading**       |
        | Labor hours per meal                        | **Leading**       |
        | Number of erroneous meals prepared per hour | **Leading**       |
        | Cost of ingredients per meal                | **Leading**       |
        | Number of meals produced per hour           | **Leading**       |

3. Gary’s Gumbo is a locally owned restaurant in Houston, Texas, with eight locations. The owner recently developed a new recipe for the restaurant’s signature gumbo dish. The owner decided to try out the dish in four of the company’s locations. After one month, the owner had gathered the following data:

   |                                                | **Locations** | **with New** | **Gumbo** | **Recipe** |      | **Locations** | **with Old** | **Gumbo** | **Recipe** |
   | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- | ---- | ------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- |
   | Location #                                     | 1             | 2            | 3         | 4          |      | 5             | 6            | 7         | 8          |
   | Number of orders                               | 1,253         | 1,386        | 1,495     | 1,377      |      | 1,112         | 1,025        | 1,224     | 997        |
   | Number of customer complaints (about the dish) | 34            | 36           | 44        | 32         |      | 12            | 9            | 6         | 8          |

   After looking over the data, the owner happily noted that the number of orders of the signature gumbo dish at the locations where the new recipe had been used (locations 1–4) had increased in comparison to the traditional number of orders of the dish (locations 5–8). The owner then decided to implement the new recipe at the rest of the company’s locations.

   1. Identify whether the decision of introducing the new gumbo recipe in all locations is correct.
      - **The number of orders increased along with complaints so the decision of the company should be reconsidered.**
   2. Identify the cognitive bias in this situation.
      - The owner of the company accepted the positive feedback and ignored the negative feedback.

4. Lonnie’s Shipping Co. is considering switching to an all-electric fleet to minimize emissions. Lonnie wants to gradually implement this change over the next 10 years. The company currently has a fleet of 100 trucks, half of which are electric-powered. Upon consulting with Lonnie, you have determined that an appropriate course of action is to include this CSR activity as a strategic objective in the company’s current balanced scorecard.

   1. Under which category of performance perspective can the CSR strategic objective of the company be included?
      - **Internal process based performance perspective**
   2. Identify a performance metric for the CSR strategic objective.
      - **The number of electric-powered trucks in the fleet.**
   3. Identify an appropriate yearly performance target for the performance metric selected in part (b).

8. Coulson and Company is a large retail business that has a firm-wide balanced scorecard. Recently, management has discussed the need for the balanced scorecard to be more relevant to each individual department of the company. Specifically, management wants to come up with unique scorecards for its Public Relations and Inventory Management departments. For both departments, management recognizes that properly and efficiently training employees is important. For these purposes, management gathers data on the median training hours per employee and new employee performance review ratings. For the Inventory Management Department, management is focused on reducing stockouts (running out of certain inventory items) and keeping accurate inventory counts. For these purposes, the company tracks the number of back orders and discrepancies between the physical and record counts of inventory, respectively. For the Public Relations Department, management is focused on improving the public’s CSR image of the company and attracting new customers. Management measures these objectives using Forbes CSR Rating of Coulson and Company and the number of new customers, respectively.

   1. Identify a name that suits the scorecard of the public relation and inventory management departments.

      - **Cascading scorecard**

   2. Identify the common metrics for both the departments in the new unique scorecards.

      - **Employee training hours and employee performance**

      Identify the unique metrics of inventory management department.

      - **Number of back orders and discrepancies in physical and record counts**

      Identify the unique metrics for the public relations department.

      - **CSR ratings for Forbes and number of new customers**

9. Silver Lining Inc. has a balanced scorecard with a strategy map that shows that delivery time and the number of erroneous shipments are expected to affect the company’s ability to satisfy the customer. Further, the strategy map for the balanced scorecard shows that the hours from ordered to delivered affects the percentage of customers who shop again, and the number of erroneous shipments affects the online customer satisfaction rating. The following information is also available:

   ​	The company’s target hours from ordered to delivered is 20.

   ​	Every hour over the ordered-to-delivered target results in a 0.5% decrease in the percentage of customers who shop again.

   ​	The company’s target number of erroneous shipments per year is no more than 65.

   ​	Every error over the erroneous shipments target results in a 0.05 point decrease in the online customer satisfaction rating and an added future financial loss of $600.

   ​	The company estimates that for every 1% decrease in the percentage of customers who shop again, future profit decreases by $5,000 and market share decreases by 0.3%.

   ​	The company also estimates that for every 1 point decrease in the overall online customer satisfaction rating (on a scale of 1 to 10), future profit decreases by $4,000 and market share decreases by 0.6%.

   Using these estimates, determine how much future profit and future market share will change if:

   ​	Average hours from ordered to shipped is 27.5.

   ​	Average shipping time (hours from shipped to delivered) is 14.3.

   ​	Number of erroneous shipments is 90.

   - Total decrease in future profit: $[([(27.5+14.3)-20]*.1\%)*5000]+([90-65]*600)+[(90-65)*.05*4000]=25450$
     Total decrease in future market share: $([(27.5+14.3)-20]*.1\%*.3\%)+[(90-65)*.05*.6\%]=1.08\%$

### Average Rate of Return—New Product

1. Hana Inc. is considering an investment in new equipment that will be used to manufacture a smartphone. The phone is expected to generate additional annual sales of 7,200 units at \$172 per unit. The equipment has a cost of \$602,600, residual value of \$45,400, and an 8-year life. The equipment can only be used to manufacture the phone. The cost to manufacture the phone follows:

   | Cost per unit: |                                           |                     |         |
   | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------- |
   |                | Direct labor                              | $28.00              |         |
   |                | Direct materials                          | 109.00              |         |
   |                | Factory overhead (including depreciation) | 19.25               |         |
   |                |                                           | Total cost per unit | $156.25 |

   Determine the average rate of return on the equipment. If required, round to the nearest whole percent.

### Compute Lead Time

3. Jackson Fabricators Inc. machines metal parts for the automotive industry. Under the traditional manufacturing approach, the parts are machined through two processes: milling and finishing. Parts are produced in batch sizes of 65 parts. A part requires 4 minutes in milling and 7 minutes in finishing. The move time between the two operations for a complete batch is 8 minutes.

   Under the lean philosophy, the part is produced in a cell that includes both the milling and finishing operations. The operating time is unchanged; however, the batch size is reduced to 3 parts and the move time is eliminated.

   Determine the value-added, non-value-added, and total lead times, and the value-added ratio under the traditional and lean manufacturing methods. If required, round percentages to one decimal place.

   - |                                  | Traditional Philosophy | Lean Manufacturing Philosophy |
     | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
     | Value-added time                 | $4+7=11$               | $4+7=11$                      |
     | Non-value-added time             | $[11*(65-1)]+8=712$    | $[11*(3-1)]+0=22$             |
     | Total lead time                  | $11+712=723$           | $11+22=33$                    |
     | Value-added ratio (as a percent) | $\frac{11}{723}=1.5\%$ | $\frac{11}{33}=33.3$          |

### Decision on Accepting Additional Business

4. Homestead Jeans Co. has an annual plant capacity of 65,000 units, and current production is 45,000 units. Monthly fixed costs are \$54,000, and variable costs are ​\$29 per unit. The present selling price is \$42 per unit. On November 12 of the current year, the company received an offer from Dawkins Company for 18,000 units of the product at ​\$32 each. Dawkins Company will market the units in a foreign country under its own brand name. The additional business is not expected to affect the domestic selling price or quantity of sales of Homestead Jeans Co.

   1. Prepare a differential analysis dated November 12 on whether to reject (Alternative 1) or accept (Alternative 2) the Dawkins order. If an amount is zero, enter "0". If required, use a minus sign to indicate a loss.

   | Total                      | $345000  |

   Com-Tel plans 3,600 hours of production for the Lion Model cell for the year. The materials cost is $82 per unit. Each assembly requires 18 minutes of cell assembly time. There was no May 1 inventory for either Raw and In Process Inventory or Finished Goods Inventory.

   The following summary events took place in the Lion Model cell during May:

   ​	Electronic parts were purchased to produce 12,250 Lion Model assemblies in May.

   ​	Conversion costs were applied for 11,650 units of production in May.

   ​	11,420 units were completed and transferred to finished goods in May.

   ​	11,080 units were shipped to customers at a price of $384 per unit.

   If required, round your answers to the nearest cent.

   1. Determine the budgeted cell conversion cost per hour.

      - $\frac{345600}{3600}=96.00$

   4. Determine the ending balance in Raw and In Process Inventory and Finished Goods Inventory.

      - Raw and In Process Inventory: $1004500+335520-1265336=74684$
        Finished Goods Inventory: $1265336-1227664=37672$

   5. Lean accounting is different from traditional accounting because it is more **simplified** and uses **minimal** control. As a result, the number of transactions are **reduced**. In many lean operations, purchased materials are charged to a **"raw and in process inventory" account**. Direct labor is **included as a conversion cost of the cell**. Often, nonfinancial performance measures, such as **lead time or quality measures** , are used to monitor performance.

### Make-or-Buy Decision for a Service Company

7. The Theater Arts Guild of Dallas (TAG-D) employs five people in its Publication Department. These people lay out pages for pamphlets, brochures, magazines, and other publications for the TAG-D productions. The pages are delivered to an outside company for printing. The company is considering an outside publication service for the layout work. The outside service is quoting a price of $13 per layout page. The budget for the Publication Department for the current year is as follows:

   | Item                  | Value    |
   | --------------------- | -------- |
   | Salaries              | $224,000 |
   | Benefits              | 36,000   |
   | Supplies              | 21,000   |
   | Office expenses       | 39,000   |
   | Office depreciation   | 28,000   |
   | Computer depreciation | 24,000   |
   | Total                 | $372,000 |

   The department expects to lay out 24,000 pages for the current year. The Publication Department office space and equipment would be used for future administrative needs, if the department's function were purchased from the outside.

   1. Prepare a differential analysis dated February 22 to determine whether TAG-D should lay out pages internally (Alternative 1) or purchase layout services from the outside (Alternative 2). If an amount is zero, enter "0".

      - | Differential Analysis<br />Lay Out Pages Internally (Alt. 1) or Purchase Layout Services (Alt. 2)<br />February 22 |                                          |                                          |                                      |

        | Office depreciation                                          |                                          | $0$                                      | $0$                                  |
        | Computer depreciation                                        |                                          | $0$                                      | $0$                                  |
        | Total costs                                                  | $224000+36000+21000+39000=320000$        | $312000$                                 | $312000-320000=-8000$                |

   2. The benefit from using an outside service is shown to be **greater** than performing the layout work internally. The fixed costs (depreciation expenses) in the budget are **irrelevant** to the decision. Thus, the work should **be** purchased from the outside on a strictly financial basis.

   3. Before electing to **lay off** the five employees, the TAG-D should consider the **long-run impact** of the decision.

### Net Present Value Method, Internal Rate of Return Method, and Analysis for a Service Company

8. The management of Advanced Alternative Power Inc. is considering two capital investment projects. The estimated net cash flows from each project are as follows:

   | Year | Wind Turbines | Biofuel Equipment |
   | ---- | ------------- | ----------------- |
   | 1    | $280,000      | $590,000          |
   | 2    | 280,000       | 590,000           |
   | 3    | 280,000       | 590,000           |
   | 4    | 280,000       | 590,000           |

   The wind turbines require an investment of \$724,920, while the biofuel equipment requires an investment of ​\$1,684,450. No residual value is expected from either project.

   | Present Value of an Annuity of $1 at Compound Interest |        |         |         |         |         |

   1.  

      1. Compute the net present value for each project. Use a rate of 10% and the present value of an annuity of $1 in the table above. If required, use the minus sign to indicate a negative net present value. If required, round to the nearest whole dollar.

         - |                                        | Wind Turbines           | Biofuel Equipment         |
           | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
           | Present value of annual net cash flows | $280000*3.170=887,600$  | $590000*3.170=1,870,300$  |
           | Less amount to be invested             | $724,920$               | $1,684,450$               |
           | Net present value                      | $887600-724920=162,680$ | $1870300-1684450=185,850$ |

      2. Compute a present value index for each project. If required, round your answers to two decimal places.

         - |                   | Present Value Index            |
           | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
           | Wind Turbines     | $\frac{887600}{724920}=1.22$   |
           | Biofuel Equipment | $\frac{1870300}{1684450}=1.11$ |

   2. Determine the internal rate of return for each project by (a) computing a present value factor for an annuity of \$1 and (b) using the present value of an annuity of ​\$1 in the table above. If required, round your present value factor answers to three decimal places and internal rate of return to the nearest whole percent.

      - |                                           | Wind Turbines                 | Biofuel Equipment              |
        | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
        | Present value factor for an annuity of $1 | $\frac{724920}{280000}=2.589$ | $\frac{1684450}{590000}=2.855$ |
        | Internal rate of return                   | $20$                          | $15$                           |

   3. The net present value, present value index, and internal rate of return all indicate that the **wind turbines** is/are a better financial opportunity compared to the **biofuel equipment** , although both investments meet the minimum return criterion of 10%.

### Performance metrics

9. Apples & Oranges Inc. is trying to become more efficient in shipping goods. It is experimenting with two new shipping procedure initiatives aimed at achieving this strategic objective. The company has provided the following data regarding the two procedures after one month of implementation:

   |                                                 | **Shipping Procedure A** | **Shipping Procedure B** |

# Chapter 25

## Pre-Lecture Videos

1. Which of the following steps is considered the first step in the managerial decision-making process?
   - **Identify the objective of the decision**
2. An analysis that evaluates differential revenues and costs in order to determine the differential impact on income of two alternative courses of action is called **incremental** analysis.
3. **Sunk** costs are costs that have been incurred in the past, cannot be recouped, and are not relevant to future decisions.
4. The revenue that is forgone from an alternative use of an asset, such as cash, is called **an opportunity cost.**
5. All of the following are cost-plus methods to determine selling price *except* **fixed cost concept**.
6. Which of the following determine normal selling price?
   - **Cost amount per unit plus markup**
7. Target cost is computed by **expected selling price minus desired profit**.
8. A point in the manufacturing process where the demand for the company's product exceeds the ability to produce the product is known as **production bottleneck**.
9. In a production bottleneck operation, the best measure of profitability is the **unit contribution margin per production bottleneck constraint**.
10. The last step when applying the total cost concept would be to **determine the normal selling price by adding the markup per unit to the cost per unit.**
11. Under the **variable cost concept**, only costs that change are included in the cost amount per unit to which the markup is added.

## Mini Quiz

1. **The theory of constraints** is a manufacturing strategy that focuses on reducing the influence of bottlenecks on the production process.

   2. Based on the results disclosed by the differential analysis, should the proposal be accepted?

      - **Yes**

   3.  If the proposal is accepted, what would be the total estimated operating income of the store for the 15 years?

      - $5400000-(3000000+950000)=1450000$

## Homework Exercises

1. Hill Co. can further process Product O to produce Product P. Product O is currently selling for \$60 per pound and costs ​\$42 per pound to produce. Product P would sell for \$82 per pound and would require an additional cost of ​\$13 per pound to produce.

   The differential revenue of producing Product P is \$22 per pound.

   - $82-60=22$ –> **True**

2. Make-or-buy options often arise when a manufacturer has excess productive capacity in the form of unused equipment, space, and labor.

   - **True**

3. When a bottleneck occurs in a process used in the production of multiple products, the company must determine the contribution margin for each product and give priority to the product that has the lowest contribution margin per bottleneck hour.

   - **False**

4. Under the variable cost method, only variable costs are included in the cost amount per unit to which the markup is added.

   - **True**

5. The amount of increase or decrease in cost that is expected from a particular course of action as compared with an alternative is **differential cost**.

6. Delaney Company is considering replacing equipment that originally cost \$600,000 and has accumulated depreciation of ​\$420,000 to date. A new machine will cost \$790,000 and the old equipment can be sold for ​\$8,000. The sunk cost in this situation is $600000-420000=180000$

7. Starling Co. is considering disposing of a machine with a book value of \$12,500 and estimated remaining life of five years. The old machine can be sold for ​\$1,500. A new high-speed machine can be purchased at a cost of \$25,000. It will have a useful life of five years and no residual value. It is estimated that the annual variable manufacturing costs will be reduced from ​\$26,000 to \$23,500 if the new machine is purchased. The five-year differential effect on profit from replacing the machine is a(n) **decrease of ** $12500-23500=(11000)$

8. Mallard Corporation uses the product cost method of product pricing. Below is cost information for the production and sale of 45,000 units of its sole product. Mallard desires a profit equal to a 12% return on invested assets of $800,000.

   | Item                                              | Value   |
   | ------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
   | Fixed factory overhead cost                       | $82,000 |
   | Fixed selling and administrative costs            | 45,000  |
   | Variable direct materials cost per unit           | 5.50    |
   | Variable direct labor cost per unit               | 7.65    |
   | Variable factory overhead cost per unit           | 2.25    |
   | Variable selling and administrative cost per unit | 0.90    |

   The unit selling price for the company's product is $21.25$

9. Widgeon Co. manufactures three products: Bales, Tales, and Wales. The selling prices are $55, $78, and \$32, respectively. The variable costs for each product are \$20, \$50, and ​\$15, respectively. Each product must go through the same processing in a machine that is limited to 2,000 hours per month. Bales take 5 hours to process; Tales 7 hours; and Wales 1 hour.

   Assuming that Widgeon Co. can sell all of the products it can make, the maximum contribution margin it can earn per month is $34000$

10. Swan Company produces its product at a total cost of \$43 per unit. Of this amount, \$8 per unit is selling and administrative costs. The total variable cost is $30 per unit, and the desired profit is \$20 per unit.

    The markup percentage on variable cost is $110\%$.

### Accept Business at Special Price

11. Product A is normally sold for \$47 per unit. A special price of ​\$31 is offered for the export market. The variable production cost is \$26 per unit. An additional export tariff of 14% of revenue must be paid for all export products. Assume there is sufficient capacity for the special order.

1. Magpie Corporation uses the total cost method of product pricing. Below is cost information for the production and sale of 60,000 units of its sole product. Magpie desires a profit equal to a 25% return on invested assets of $700,000.

   | Item                                              | Value   |
   | ------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
   | Fixed factory overhead cost                       | $38,700 |
   | Fixed selling and administrative costs            | 7,500   |
   | Variable direct materials cost per unit           | 4.60    |
   | Variable direct labor cost per unit               | 1.88    |
   | Variable factory overhead cost per unit           | 1.13    |
   | Variable selling and administrative cost per unit | 4.50    |

   The markup percentage on total cost for Magpie's product is $\frac{700000*25\%}{38700+7500+[(4.6+1.88+1.13+4.5)*60000]}=22.6\%$

2. All of the following should be considered in a make-or-buy decision **quality issues with the supplier**, **future growth in the plant and other production opportunities**, and **cost savings**.

3. The amount of increase or decrease in revenue that is expected from a particular course of action as compared with an alternative is **differential revenue**.

4. Carmen Co. can further process Product J to produce Product D. Product J is currently selling for \$20.00 per pound and costs ​\$15.75 per pound to produce. Product D would sell for \$38.00 per pound and would require an additional cost of ​\$8.55 per pound to produce.

   The differential revenue of producing Product D is $38-20=$ **$18.00 per pound​**.

5. Dotterel Corporation uses the variable cost method of product pricing. Below is cost information for the production and sale of 35,000 units of its sole product. Dotterel desires a profit equal to an 11.2% return on invested assets of $350,000.

   | Item                                              | Value    |
   | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
   | Fixed factory overhead cost                       | $105,000 |
   | Fixed selling and administrative costs            | 35,000   |
   | Variable direct materials cost per unit           | 4.34     |
   | Variable direct labor cost per unit               | 5.18     |
   | Variable factory overhead cost per unit           | 0.98     |
   | Variable selling and administrative cost per unit | 0.70     |

   The dollar amount of desired profit from the production and sale of Dotterel's product is $350000*11.2\%=39200$

   1. Assuming that the desired rate of return is 15%, determine the net present value for the proposal. **If required, round to the nearest dollar.** Use the table of the present value of \$1 presented above.
      - Present value of net cash flow: $(80000*.87)+(65000*.756)+(50000*.658)+(40000*.572)=174520$
      - Amount to be invested: $150000$
      - Net present value: $174520-150000=24520$
   2. Would management be likely to look with favor on the proposal?
      - **Yes** , because the net present value indicates that the return on the proposal is **greater** than the minimum desired rate of return of 15%.

    1. Assuming that the desired rate of return is 6%, determine the net present value for the proposal. Use the table of the present value of \$1 presented above. *If required, round to the nearest dollar.* If required, use the minus sign to indicate a negative net present value.
       - Present value of net cash flow: $(75000*.943)+(58000*.89)+(44000*.84)+(29000*.792)=182273$
       - Amount to be invested: $149500$
       - Net present value: $182273-149500=32773$
    2. Would management be likely to look with favor on the proposal?
       - **Yes** , because the net present value indicates that the return on the proposal is **greater** than the minimum desired rate of return of 6%.

### Process Activity Analysis

9. Roen Company incurred an activity cost of \$105,600 for inspecting 40,000 units of production. Management determined that the inspecting objectives could be met without inspecting every unit. Therefore, rather than inspecting 40,000 units of production, the inspection activity was limited to a random selection of 5,000 units out of the 40,000 units of production.

   Determine the inspection activity cost per unit on 40,000 units of total production both before and after the improvement. If required, round per unit amounts to the nearest cent.

   - Inspection activity before improvement: $\frac{105600}{40000}=2.64$
     Inspection activity after improvement: $\frac{5000*2.64}{40000}=.33$
